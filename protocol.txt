The Nukeproof Protocol: Federated
European Storage for Digital Sovereignty
Abstract
SpaceTime Ltd White Paper – May 2025. Europe faces a digital sovereignty challenge as
critical data and infrastructure remain dependent on foreign cloud giants. Regulatory
developments such as GDPR, the Schrems II ruling, NIS2, and concerns over the U.S. CLOUD
Act underscore the urgency for EU-governed solutions. The Nukeproof Protocol is introduced
as a visionary response: a federated European storage network that empowers local cloud
providers (SpaceStations) to deliver sovereign, resilient, and high-performance cloud storage.
This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the Nukeproof Protocol’s context,
architecture, and strategic value. We analyze Europe’s cloud sovereignty crisis, detail the
Nukeproof Protocol’s design as a pan-European storage fabric, and present real-world
validation from a successful Finland pilot (serving 5,000+ SMEs and 100+ public agencies). We
also explore sector-specific benefits for government, regulated industries, and AI innovation,
outline the roadmap for expansion (from storage today to compute integration tomorrow), and
explain the underlying technology principles (including blockchain coordination inspired by
Chia). Aligned with EU regulations and policy goals, the Nukeproof Protocol offers a path to
regain control of Europe’s data destiny. We conclude with a call to action for governments,
industry partners, and investors to unite in scaling this sovereign infrastructure.
Executive Summary
●
●
Europe’s Digital Sovereignty at Risk: European businesses and governments have
become heavily reliant on non-European “hyperscale” cloud providers (AWS, Microsoft
Azure, Google Cloud). By 2022, three U.S. companies controlled roughly 72% of
Europe’s cloud infrastructure spend , raising alarms about over-dependence. This
reliance poses legal and strategic risks: EU data stored with U.S. providers is subject to
U.S. jurisdiction (via laws like the CLOUD Act) despite being on European soil . Major
rulings like Schrems II have invalidated transatlantic data transfer agreements,
intensifying uncertainty around using American clouds . Meanwhile, new EU regulations
(GDPR, NIS2) demand stricter control over data and supply chains, prompting the
question: Can European organizations truly comply if their critical data is held by foreign
entities? European industry leaders insist that the EU “cannot afford to be dependent on
external influences” and needs a “truly sovereign digital ecosystem”
.
Risks of Hyperscaler Dependence: Relying on hyperscalers entails multiple strategic
risks. Legal risk: U.S. laws like the CLOUD Act allow foreign authorities to access
EU-hosted data , clashing with EU privacy principles and potentially violating GDPR .
●
●
Compliance burden: The Schrems II decision forces companies to perform
case-by-case data transfer assessments and implement European-controlled encryption
to protect data, adding cost and complexity . Lock-in and cost: Hyperscalers’ business
models can trap customers — for example, exorbitant data egress fees effectively “hold
customer data hostage,
” making it costly to switch providers . Security and continuity:
Outages or geopolitical tensions could disrupt access to critical services if Europe has no
independent alternative. An industry group of European cloud providers (CISPE) warned
that foreign governments could even seize or block access to data, calling for
“‘Trump-proof’” cloud infrastructure immune to non-EU interference . They note that
diverting even 10% of public-sector cloud spend to European clouds would reinvest €20
billion per year into local infrastructure , strengthening autonomy. In short, the status quo
leaves Europe vulnerable in legal, operational, and economic terms.
The Nukeproof Protocol – A European Solution: SpaceTime Ltd’s Nukeproof
Protocol is a bold initiative to address these challenges by building a federated
European storage network. Instead of a single monolithic provider, Nukeproof links
together a constellation of local cloud/storage providers across EU member states –
known as SpaceStations – into one cohesive network. This protocol’s vision is to
ensure that European data remains under European jurisdiction and control at all times,
while delivering cloud-grade scalability and resilience. By distributing data across
multiple independent EU-based nodes with advanced encryption and redundancy, the
network is effectively “nuke-proof”
– extraordinarily resilient against outages, breaches,
or unilateral control. No single government or corporate entity (including SpaceTime
itself) can compromise the data’s integrity or availability. The Nukeproof architecture
leverages modern technology (including blockchain-based coordination and
proof-of-storage mechanisms akin to Chia’s Proof of Space and Time) to orchestrate
trust among participants without a centralized data controller. The result is a
storage-as-a-service platform that offers the performance and cost-efficiency to rival
hyperscalers, while remaining 100% EU-sovereign and compliant. This paper details
the Nukeproof Protocol’s design, from the role of SpaceStations to the underlying
technical principles that enable federated operation.
SpaceStations – Local Nodes, Global Network: Each SpaceStation is a robust
storage node (or cluster) operated by a local trusted provider (such as a regional
datacenter, ISP, or MSP) and interconnected via the Nukeproof Protocol.
SpaceStations bring storage physically closer to users (improving latency and
performance) and ensure data residency in specific jurisdictions as needed. They are
turn-key appliances managed by SpaceTime’s platform for consistency and security,
but owned/operated by partners in each region. Key features of SpaceStations include
automatic replication and data rebalancing – when new nodes join, data is redistributed
securely across the expanded pool to form a unified storage fabric with no downtime.
They are workload-optimized (supporting use cases from backups and archives to AI
datasets and IoT streams) with built-in ransomware protection and support for
industry-standard backup software (e.g. Veeam, Acronis) for easy integration .
SpaceTime’s remote management of these nodes relieves local operators of complex
maintenance, while end-to-end encryption ensures SpaceTime (or any intermediary)
●
●
cannot see customer data. In essence, SpaceStations act as the building blocks of a
pan-European cloud: each is powerful on its own, but their true strength is unlocked
when federated via the Nukeproof Protocol.
Validated in Finland – 5,000+ SMEs and 100+ Agencies: The Nukeproof approach is
not just theoretical. A pilot deployment in Finland has demonstrated its real-world
viability at scale. Over 5,500 small and mid-sized businesses and 100+ government
and public sector entities in Finland have been successfully using the SpaceTime
storage network as an alternative to U.S. clouds. This early adoption (encompassing
diverse sectors from municipal IT systems to private enterprise backups) shows that a
federated model can deliver production-grade service to thousands of customers. The
Finland pilot has provided valuable insights: local MSP partners can easily integrate
SpaceStations into their offerings, end-users gain faster and more predictable
performance by keeping data within national/European boundaries, and critical
workloads achieve high availability across multiple sites. Moreover, Finnish government
bodies have found renewed confidence that sensitive citizen data (from healthcare
records to public registries) stays under Finnish/EU jurisdiction without sacrificing cloud
convenience. This successful case study is a microcosm of what the Nukeproof Protocol
can achieve across Europe. The lessons learned in Finland – in compliance, operational
best practices, and partner enablement – are now informing a broader European rollout.
Sector-Specific Benefits: A European federated cloud storage network carries
profound benefits across various sectors:
○
Public Sector & Government: Government agencies and public administrations
gain full sovereignty over their data, addressing the Schrems II and CLOUD Act
concerns by ensuring data never leaves EU legal protection. By using
Nukeproof’s network of domestic/EU providers, governments can comply with
GDPR and national data residency laws for sensitive information. The resilience
of a multi-node network also supports continuity of government services even if
one data center fails or is under attack. Ultimately, the public sector can
confidently adopt cloud innovations (e.g. digital citizen services, smart city
platforms) knowing the infrastructure is wholly governed by EU jurisdiction and
immune to foreign political whims .
○
Regulated Enterprises (Finance, Healthcare, etc.): Banks, insurers, hospitals,
and other regulated organizations handle highly sensitive personal data and must
meet strict compliance standards. Nukeproof storage ensures customer data
remains in trusted European locations with rigorous security, aiding compliance
with financial regulations, health data directives, and GDPR. It simplifies risk
management by removing reliance on overseas cloud providers that might be
compelled to breach confidentiality. Additionally, avoidance of vendor lock-in and
predatory pricing (like high egress fees) means these enterprises regain cost
control and negotiating power for their infrastructure. They can adopt
cloud-like scalability for big data analytics or disaster recovery, without violating
data sovereignty or facing unpredictable costs. For example, a hospital could
securely store genomic databases or medical images on SpaceTime’s network,
confident that only EU-regulated entities ever handle the encrypted data.
●
○
AI, Research and Digital Innovation: Europe’s startups and research
institutions in AI and data science require massive datasets and sandbox
environments to innovate. The Nukeproof Protocol provides scalable,
high-performance storage needed for AI training and big data, but with the
crucial advantage of compliance and local data control. AI developers can train
models on sensitive European datasets (e.g. healthcare or public data) entirely
within an EU cloud network, simplifying legal hurdles and ensuring ethical data
use. Moreover, by distributing storage across Europe, data-intensive applications
can leverage proximity to data sources (reducing latency) and even comply
with emerging AI regulations (such as the upcoming EU AI Act) that may require
certain data to remain in certified secure data spaces. SpaceTime’s alignment
with EU initiatives (it is “Article 58 compliant” and ready to support AI Act
regulatory sandboxes via European Digital Innovation Hubs) underscores this
benefit . In sum, the federated infrastructure fuels innovation by providing
European entrepreneurs and researchers a cloud platform that is both powerful
and policy-aligned, enabling experimentation without compromising on trust or
sovereignty.
Roadmap: From Storage to a Full Sovereign Cloud: The immediate focus of
Nukeproof Protocol (Phase 1) is pan-European storage – establishing a dense network
of SpaceStations across all EU regions and EFTA countries, so that every member state
has local cloud capacity connected to the federation. The rollout strategy prioritizes
inclusivity, bringing onboard providers from Nordic countries to Southern Europe,
from Western hubs to Eastern emerging markets in parallel. Rather than concentrate
only on the largest markets, SpaceTime’s approach ensures all EU citizens and
businesses can benefit from local cloud services, thereby fostering digital cohesion.
Following the storage network build-out, Phase 2 will integrate compute
capabilitiesinto the federated cloud. In practical terms, this means evolving
SpaceStations (and new “SpaceCompute” nodes) to not only store data but also to
process it – supporting containerized applications, edge computing, and eventually full
cloud workloads on European soil. Once implemented, a company could store its data
and run its servers on this unified European cloud, with data gravity ensuring
computation happens near the data. The long-term roadmap (Phase 3 and beyond)
envisions a comprehensive sovereign cloud ecosystem: a platform where storage,
processing, and even network connectivity are orchestrated across Europe’s federated
infrastructure. Future iterations may leverage the network’s distributed nature to optimize
for AI and machine learning tasks (e.g. moving compute to data for compliance), and
incorporate emerging tech like quantum-resistant encryption and secure distributed
computing. Each phase will be executed in close collaboration with European
stakeholders and in alignment with EU industrial and digital strategies. Timeline: The
storage federation is already underway (with operational pilots like Finland); the compute
integration is planned in the next development cycle as the network’s capacity and
partnerships mature. Throughout expansion, maintaining European data governance,
performance parity with hyperscalers, and interoperability (e.g. via open APIs) will
guide the implementation.
●
Technical Foundations – Security and Decentralization: The Nukeproof Protocol’s
architecture is underpinned by modern, zero-trust security and decentralized
coordination:
○
Blockchain Coordination: At the heart of Nukeproof’s federated control plane is
a blockchain-inspired ledger that coordinates storage operations and verifies
integrity across many independent providers. By using a proof-of-space-time
mechanism (similar to the one pioneered by Chia Network), the system can
cryptographically verify that each SpaceStation is reserving the promised
storage and maintaining data over time . This means that trust is established
via math and consensus rather than relying solely on contracts. The blockchain
coordination layer logs where data fragments reside (without exposing their
content), tracks provider performance, and can even automate incentives or
penalties for reliability. Importantly, this ledger is energy-efficient – unlike
Bitcoin’s wasteful proof-of-work, proof-of-space leverages spare disk capacity
and minimal CPU, aligning with Europe’s green computing goals.
○
Data Sharding and Redundancy: Nukeproof employs advanced data
distribution techniques (erasure coding and multi-site replication) to split and
spread data across multiple SpaceStations. For example, a file uploaded to the
network might be divided into several encrypted chunks, stored in different
countries or with different providers. No single node holds a full readable copy,
and a threshold (e.g. any 3 of 5 chunks) can reconstruct the data. This approach
yields tolerance to failures – even if one or two nodes suffer outages or attacks,
the data remains available from others. It also enhances legal protection: an
outside actor would require jurisdiction in multiple EU countries to compel access
to all fragments, an extremely high bar. The redundancy scheme is configurable
to meet specific needs (higher replication for ultra-critical data, or localization if
data must remain in a particular nation). In all cases, end-to-end encryption
ensures that only the data owner holds the keys; SpaceTime and its partners
cannot decrypt client data, which is crucial for compliance (and is “encryption
neutral” with respect to lawful access, meaning even if a provider is served a
request, they technically cannot hand over plaintext).
○
Performance Optimization: Despite being distributed, the network is optimized
for high throughput and low latency. SpaceStations are equipped with modern
hardware including Data Processing Units (DPUs)and AI-accelerated caching
algorithms to expedite data retrieval and deduplication. The protocol routes user
requests to the optimal node (or nodes) – typically the nearest geographically or
network-wise – reducing latency. In practice, a user in Germany accessing data
will retrieve it from a nearby EU node with minimal added delay compared to a
single-cloud setup. The system also supports smart data placement, where
frequently accessed data can be cached at multiple regional nodes for faster
access, while less-used data remains in deep storage across a few nodes. This
intelligent placement is managed by SpaceTime’s central AI algorithms,
continuously learning usage patterns but without violating privacy (all decisions
are based on metadata and access frequency, not content).
●
○
Interoperability and Standards: The Nukeproof Protocol is built with open
standards in mind. It provides APIs and interfaces compatible with popular cloud
storage protocols (S3-compatible endpoints, etc.), making adoption seamless for
enterprises. It also aligns with European interoperability initiatives – for instance,
the design is congruent with the vision of Gaia-X for an open, transparent
ecosystem . SpaceTime’s implementation can integrate with or complement
Gaia-X frameworks, and the company actively participates in standardization
efforts to ensure the federated network can plug into broader multi-cloud
management platforms. In essence, the technology is not a closed proprietary
system, but a framework that others could adopt – a blueprint for European
sovereign cloud that could be expanded or replicated by various consortia.
○
Security & Compliance by Design: Every layer of the Nukeproof stack
incorporates security best practices meeting or exceeding EU regulations. Data is
encrypted in transit and at rest, with keys managed through European-hosted
KMS (Key Management Systems) or customer-held keys for maximum control.
The blockchain ledger provides an immutable audit trail of where data is stored
and how it’s accessed, aiding compliance audits and cybersecurity oversight.
Additionally, since providers in the network are vetted European entities, all data
processing agreements remain under EU GDPR scope – no hidden
sub-processing overseas. The protocol’s decentralized nature also mitigates the
risk of massive centralized breaches; an attacker would face a fragmented target.
NIS2 compliance: By treating each SpaceStation and link as critical
infrastructure, the network design facilitates compliance with the NIS2 Directive’s
stringent security controls and reporting (SpaceTime provides monitoring and
incident response support across the federation, helping local operators meet
their obligations). Overall, the technical foundation of Nukeproof marries
cutting-edge distributed tech with a rigorous compliance-oriented approach,
ensuring the system is not only innovative but trustworthy for even the most
sensitive applications.
Alignment with EU Policy Goals: The Nukeproof Protocol is strategically aligned with
Europe’s quest for digital sovereignty and a thriving domestic cloud sector:
○
GDPR and Schrems II: By keeping personal data within the EU’s jurisdictional
shield, Nukeproof allows companies to avoid risky international transfers and the
legal uncertainty they bring . This directly addresses the Schrems II concerns –
EU data stays in EU clouds under EU law, largely eliminating the need for
complex transfer impact assessments or reliance on foreign assurances. It gives
European data controllers a straightforward path to GDPR compliance: a cloud
where data sovereignty is assured by architecture. As one example, the CISPE
(Cloud Infrastructure Providers in Europe) Code of Conduct under GDPR
emphasizes offering customers options to keep data in Europe ; Nukeproof fulfills
this principle inherently.
○
NIS2 and Cybersecurity: NIS2 identifies cloud services as critical infrastructure
and demands stronger security and oversight of supply chains . The Nukeproof
model answers this by creating a secure European supply chain of cloud storage
○
○
○
– each provider in-network is accountable under EU law and supervised through
SpaceTime’s unified governance. Cross-border legal control – a key NIS2 issue –
is mitigated since there is no dependency on non-EU entities. Additionally, the
federated approach adds resilience, a key goal of NIS2, since a network of many
nodes is harder to compromise than a single central cloud. European regulators
looking to enforce NIS2 will find in Nukeproof an ally: it proves that compliance
can spur innovation (new business for local providers) rather than hinder it.
EU Data Strategy and GAIA-X: The European Commission’s data strategy and
projects like Gaia-X aim to foster an open, trustworthy data infrastructure for
Europe . Nukeproof is a concrete instantiation of these ideals. It pools
distributed cloud resources through open frameworks, rather than relying on
one company to dominate . This mirrors the Gaia-X philosophy of federating
existing providers into an interoperable ecosystem. In fact, industry voices have
suggested that Europe should not try to clone a single Silicon Valley giant, but
instead unite its numerous smaller providers in a common framework – exactly
what the Nukeproof Protocol accomplishes. By using open standards and
encouraging broad participation, SpaceTime’s approach could serve as a
blueprint or partner project to Gaia-X and similar EU initiatives. The outcome is
increased competitiveness of European cloud offerings and reduced dependency
on foreign technology, fulfilling a top EU policy objective.
Digital Sovereignty and Industrial Policy: Ensuring European digital
sovereignty is not just a technical issue but a strategic one. Initiatives are
underway at the EU level to invest in next-generation cloud, edge, and data
spaces (for example, through the Digital Europe Programme and national
recovery plans). The Nukeproof Protocol aligns with these policy efforts and
could readily absorb public-private support. It’s an instrument to achieve the EU’s
“technological sovereignty” ambition: in the words of one CEO, building a
“secure, independent and future-proof digital infrastructure… that ensures digital
sovereignty” for Europe . Furthermore, by nurturing a network of European cloud
providers, the Nukeproof model boosts local economies, fosters competition, and
keeps data-related value within Europe – all key outcomes desired by
policymakers. It also complements emerging regulations like the EU Data Act,
which calls for easier cloud switching and safeguards against unlawful data
access from abroad; Nukeproof’s design inherently enables multi-provider
flexibility and shields data from extraterritorial reach, supporting the spirit of the
Data Act and related policies.
AI and Innovation Policy: Europe’s policymakers have stressed that leadership
in AI and the digital economy requires robust domestic infrastructure. The
investments by hyperscalers in AI data centers are massive , but often serve
non-European interests first . The Nukeproof Protocol provides an avenue for
Europe to invest in its own AI-capable infrastructure (with high-speed storage and
soon computing) to support innovation on European terms. By aligning with the
forthcoming EU AI Act (through secure sandboxes and data governance), it
ensures that European innovators can comply with new rules without being
forced onto foreign infrastructure. This synergy with regulatory goals means the
Nukeproof network can be a foundation for Europe’s digital future in a regulated
but growth-friendly environment.
●
Call to Action – Empowering Europe’s Digital Future: SpaceTime Ltd invites
governments, cloud providers, and investors to join in scaling the Nukeproof Protocol
across Europe. For governments and public sector IT leaders: the message is clear – it
is time to prioritize sovereign options in procurement and IT planning. As urged by
industry groups, European governments should require truly EU-sovereign cloud
solutions for sensitive sectors . By directing demand (and funding) towards federated
European infrastructure, governments can drastically accelerate the build-out of this
network, fortifying national security and data autonomy in the process. We encourage
policymakers to consider supportive measures such as sovereign cloud procurement
mandates, co-investment in regional SpaceStations (perhaps via EU recovery funds or
public-private partnerships), and a favorable regulatory environment that certifies and
promotes sovereign cloud services . For European cloud and data center operators:
Nukeproof offers a unique opportunity to unite and compete. We call on local providers,
telcos, and integrators across the EU to partner with SpaceTime – host a SpaceStation,
become part of the federation, and collectively offer a credible alternative to the
hyperscalers. By joining, partners gain cutting-edge technology and a broader customer
reach, turning what was once competition with trillion-dollar giants into collaboration
under a common banner. Finally, for investors and the EU tech ecosystem: supporting
the Nukeproof expansion is not just altruism for sovereignty, it is also smart business.
The European cloud market is large and growing – by embracing the federated model,
there is potential to unlock significant market share that currently leaves the region.
Investing in SpaceTime’s initiative or similar sovereign cloud efforts taps into a
multi-billion euro opportunity as even a small repatriation of cloud spend yields huge
local dividends . Moreover, it positions investors at the forefront of a paradigm shift in
cloud computing, one that aligns with macro trends of data localization and decentralized
tech.
In conclusion, the Nukeproof Protocol represents a timely convergence of technology and
policy – a homegrown European cloud network that addresses pressing sovereignty
concerns without sacrificing innovation or performance. It turns the EU’s ideals of data
protection, openness, and resilience into a tangible platform already proven on a national scale.
Scaling it to the pan-European level is the next step. Europe stands at a crossroads: continue
with business-as-usual and remain vulnerable, or embrace a new path and secure its digital
destiny. SpaceTime Ltd and its partners have charted the course with Nukeproof. We invite
Europe’s leaders, innovators, and guardians of data to join us in this mission. Together, we can
ensure that Europe’s data infrastructure is as resilient and independent as the name
suggests – Nukeproof.
Introduction: Europe’s Digital Sovereignty Crisis
In recent years, European policymakers, businesses, and citizens have grown acutely aware
that control over data is a matter of sovereignty.
“Digital sovereignty” refers to the EU’s ability
to retain autonomy over its digital infrastructure, data, and technological decision-making. This
issue has moved to the forefront due to both regulatory developmentsand market realities
that expose Europe’s heavy reliance on foreign (primarily U.S.
-based) cloud services.
Regulatory and Jurisdictional Challenges
A series of high-profile laws and court decisions have highlighted a fundamental conflict:
European data protection vs. foreign jurisdiction. The EU’s General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR), in force since 2018, set the gold standard for personal data privacy. GDPR
strictly regulates how personal data can be processed and transferred, requiring that individuals’
information remain under strong protections even if moved outside the EU. In practice, many
European companies had been transferring data to US-based cloud servers under frameworks
like the Privacy Shield(an EU–US agreement) – but that changed abruptly in July 2020 with the
Schrems II judgment.
The Court of Justice of the EU, in Schrems II, invalidated the EU–US Privacy Shield
arrangement . The court found that US surveillance laws meant EU citizens’ data could not be
adequately protected if stored by US electronic communications service providers, even if the
data resided in Europe. Effectively, a primary legal basis for transatlantic data transfers was
struck down. Companies were left to rely on Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) with added
safeguards, but the ruling mandated case-by-case assessments and “supplementary measures”
(like stronger encryption or pseudonymization) whenever EU personal data is handled by a
US-linked entity . This dramatically increased the compliance burden on any European
organization using US-headquartered cloud services.
Compounding the issue, the U.S. has its own laws that claim extraterritorial reach. The U.S.
CLOUD Act (Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act of 2018) expressly allows American
authorities (with proper legal process) to demand data from US-based tech companies,
regardless of where the data is physically stored. In other words, if a European company stores
information with, say, a US cloud provider, that data is accessible under US law even if stored
in an EU datacenter . As one analysis succinctly put it, for EU customers of U.S. clouds, their
data is “only technically in Europe. Legally, it’s not.
” This jurisdictional dilemma strikes at the
heart of EU sovereignty – it means foreign powers have a legal backdoor to European data,
potentially bypassing the protections of European law.
European regulators have not been idle in face of these concerns. Beyond the well-known
GDPR, new regulations are expanding oversight of digital infrastructure. The Network and
Information Security Directive 2 (NIS2), which came into force in January 2023, is one such
measure. NIS2 broadens the definition of critical infrastructure to explicitly include cloud
services, data centers, and digital providers . It imposes stricter cybersecurity risk
management and reporting obligations on them. Crucially, NIS2 emphasizes supply chain
security and cross-border cooperation . Providers must ensure not only their own
cybersecurity but also that of their suppliers and partners. For a European company, using a
non-EU cloud is now a supply chain risk that could jeopardize NIS2 compliance if that cloud
cannot fully guarantee EU-equivalent security and accountability standards. As the SpaceTime
team bluntly queried,
“Can a European company truly be compliant if its data is stored by a
non-European provider?”
. The implication: relying on outside clouds might soon become not
just a privacy concern, but a regulatory one – potentially inviting penalties if the arrangement
fails EU laws.
From GDPR to Schrems II to NIS2, the regulatory trajectory is clear. The EU is tightening the
reins on data leaving its domain or being exposed to foreign law. Additionally, initiatives like the
proposed EU–US Data Privacy Framework (a Privacy Shield successor) are in motion but face
skepticism that they’ll satisfy EU courts. In the interim, many data protection authorities advise
against transferring sensitive personal data to non-EU clouds without strong safeguards. The
message to European organizations is increasingly: keep your data at home, or keep it
encrypted. This creates both a challenge and an opportunity – a challenge for those dependent
on global cloud platforms, but an opportunity for European alternatives that can assure data
stays under EU rule of law.
Cloud Dependency and Hyperscaler Risks
On the market side of the equation, Europe’s dependency on a few foreign tech giants for cloud
infrastructure has become a strategic vulnerability.
“Hyperscalers”
– typically referring to
Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) – dominate
the cloud computing industry worldwide, and Europe is no exception. By Q2 2022, these three
companies alone accounted for almost three-quarters (72%) of enterprise cloud spending in
Europe . European providers, despite growth in absolute terms, saw their market share shrink,
capturing only ~13% of the market by 2022 . This imbalance has only marginally improved (if at
all) in recent years. Essentially, Europe’s cloud infrastructure – the backbone for everything from
websites and apps to industrial services and government digital systems – is largely outsourced
to foreign entities.
Such concentration of critical infrastructure in the hands of a few non-EU firms poses multiple
risks:
●
Geopolitical Risk and Sovereignty: As noted, foreign governments could leverage
their jurisdiction over hyperscalers to compromise European data sovereignty. This risk
isn’t just theoretical. The CLOUD Act is often dubbed a tool that can cause “transatlantic
trust” issues , and European officials have worried about scenarios where international
disputes or shifting political winds (e.g. a more aggressive stance by a future U.S.
administration) might lead to data access or service cutoff. Indeed, European cloud
providers through CISPE have explicitly called for “Trump-proof” cloud services – an
infrastructure resilient to potential disruption or access by non-European governments .
The dependency means Europe’s digital operations could be caught in the crossfire of
geopolitical conflicts or diplomatic rows that have nothing to do with Europe’s own
policies. In a crisis, Europe cannot confidently ensure continuity of cloud services if those
services are controlled abroad.
●
●
●
Economic and Competitive Risk: Cloud computing is not just an expense; it’s an
investment in innovation and digital capability. When European companies pay billions to
foreign cloud providers, a portion of that value (and data expertise) flows out of the
European economy. Over time, local cloud industries have struggled to compete – as
seen by declining market share despite growth . This raises concerns about innovation
sovereignty: the ability for Europe to develop its own next-generation platforms (from AI
to IoT) could be hampered if foundational infrastructure is imported. Moreover, there’s a
competition aspect: domestic providers find it hard to scale when facing giants that
benefit from global economies of scale and massive capital. The CISPE group argues
that even a modest re-balancing (10% shift of cloud spend to European providers) would
greatly stimulate Europe’s tech sector, injecting €20 billion annually into local companies
and infrastructure investments .
Vendor Lock-In and Cost Exploitation: While hyperscalers offer excellent technology,
they have also developed practices that critics argue exploit customer lock-in. One
infamous example is data egress fees – charges to move data out of a cloud. These
fees can be so prohibitively high that customers are effectively “locked” into staying with
the provider, analogous to a “ransom” on their data . A European company that has
terabytes of data on a U.S. cloud might face a hefty bill to repatriate that data or switch
to a competitor, disincentivizing free choice. In a SpaceTime analysis, AWS’s egress
pricing was likened to ransomware tactics: customers must pay steeply to access or
move their own data . Such costs, often buried or complex to calculate, can strain IT
budgets – particularly for startups and SMEs – and create dependency not because of
superior service but because of financial barriers to exit. Additionally, hyperscalers have
been known to vary pricing by region, sometimes charging European customers more
for the same service, which exploits the lack of alternatives in those markets .
Security and Resilience Risk: Centralizing much of Europe’s data with a handful of
providers can create single points of failure. Although hyperscalers have robust
infrastructures, outages do occur. A major cloud outage can disrupt thousands of
businesses at once. If those clouds are foreign, Europe has limited recourse or priority in
such events. There’s also a strategic resilience issue: if a hyperscaler decided (or was
forced by its government) to cut off services to a segment of European users, the impact
would be immediate and widespread. While this scenario is unlikely in normal
circumstances, the mere possibility underscores a loss of control. European defense and
intelligence officials have also voiced concerns about dependency for critical systems on
foreign technology, equating it to dependency on foreign energy or defense equipment.
Cybersecurity is another facet – a breach or backdoor in a major foreign cloud could
have sweeping consequences in Europe, and oversight is complicated when the
provider’s operations are opaque and outside EU full jurisdiction.
In summary, Europe’s current cloud landscape is characterized by high reliance on external
providers which introduces legal uncertainties, strategic vulnerabilities, and potential economic
drawbacks. The situation has drawn the attention of top EU leaders and industry bodies. As
IONOS CEO Achim Weiß remarked,
“Europe cannot afford to be dependent on external
influences… We need a strong and truly sovereign digital ecosystem.
” There is a broad
recognition that regaining cloud sovereignty is not about isolationism, but about balance and
control – ensuring Europe can provide for its own needs and set its own rules in the digital
realm.
The response to these challenges has been multi-pronged. The EU launched projects like
Gaia-X, a multi-stakeholder initiative to create an open, federated data infrastructure in Europe .
Similarly, policies in the EU’s Digital Compass 2030 set targets for cloud uptake and promoting
European solutions. Industry coalitions via CISPE updated Digital Sovereignty Principles in
2025, urging concrete steps like EU-first procurement and certification for European cloud
services . The stage is set for solutions that can translate these principles and policies into
action.
It’s in this context that SpaceTime’s Nukeproof Protocol emerges – aiming to tackle head-on
the twin issues of compliance and dependency by providing a European-led alternative. In the
sections that follow, we delve into the Nukeproof Protocol’s vision and design, illustrating how it
seeks to resolve the sovereignty dilemma by empowering Europe’s own cloud capabilities.
The Nukeproof Protocol: Vision of a Federated European
Storage Network
The Nukeproof Protocol is SpaceTime Ltd’s answer to Europe’s cloud sovereignty conundrum
– a unified storage network built by Europeans, for Europeans. At its core, Nukeproof is an
architecture and set of protocols that federate independent cloud storage nodes across
different locations and organizations into a single, seamless cloud storage service. The ethos
behind the name “Nukeproof” speaks to its guiding principle: extreme resilience and security.
Just as a nuclear bunker is designed to survive catastrophic events, the Nukeproof storage
network is engineered to keep data safe and accessible even under the most adverse
conditions – be it datacenter outages, cyberattacks, or legal assaults on data privacy.
Vision and Objectives
The vision for Nukeproof Protocol is ambitious yet straightforward: create a sovereign
European cloud that rivals the performance of hyperscalers while eliminating single
points of control or failure. This vision breaks down into several key objectives:
●
●
Data Sovereignty: Ensure that data stored on the network never falls under foreign
jurisdiction. This is achieved by confining the storage nodes to European territory and
under European entities. Data can be stored locally (within a country or region as
required) but is always within the EU legal framework. Customers using Nukeproof can
definitively know that their data is governed solely by EU laws (and local laws of the EU
member state hosting it), not by the laws of another country via proxy.
Federation over Centralization: Instead of building one giant data center network
owned by a single company, Nukeproof’s approach is federated – it connects many
smaller and mid-sized providers, cloud companies, and even on-premise enterprise
●
●
●
clouds into one network. This taps into Europe’s existing IT infrastructure and talent.
Europe may not have one cloud titan on the scale of AWS, but it has hundreds of
capable data center operators, IT service firms, and regional cloud providers. The
Nukeproof Protocol provides the common language and standards for these players to
interoperate, effectively behaving as a virtual mega-cloud when seen by end users, but
without concentration of ownership or control.
Hyper-Resilience: By design, the federated network avoids any single point of failure.
Data is distributed (both geographically and across organizations), so no one outage or
incident can take down the service globally. Even SpaceTime, as the designer of the
protocol, is not a centralized dependency for data availability – once the network is up
and data is distributed, it would continue to function and preserve data even if any one
node or company (or a subset of them) faced issues. This is a fundamentally different
risk model from a traditional cloud, where one company’s outage (like a major AWS
region going down) can incapacitate large swathes of the internet. Nukeproof’s
distributed ledger and consensus mechanisms also mean that the system can
automatically route around failures or compromised nodes.
Competitive Performance and Cost: A sovereign cloud will only gain adoption if it can
meet the bar set by commercial hyperscalers in service quality. SpaceTime’s goal is to
ensure Nukeproof-based services are as fast, scalable, and cost-efficient as
mainstream cloud storage. This entails leveraging cutting-edge tech: high-speed
networks connecting the nodes, edge caching, efficient storage software, and economies
of scale through federation. A user storing data in the Nukeproof network should
experience comparable upload/download speeds and reliability as they would with a
top-tier cloud provider – but with the added assurance of sovereignty. Likewise, costs are
managed through a usage-based model that avoids heavy overhead. SpaceTime’s
model of empowering local providers with its software helps reduce their operating costs
(through automation and remote management), which translates into affordable pricing
for end customers. The network’s collective scale also allows it to negotiate hardware
and bandwidth efficiencies (as if it were one large cloud). In short, Nukeproof is meant
to be not a compromise, but a competitive choice on technical and economic
grounds, while also delivering strategic independence.
Trust through Transparency: Trust is a crucial currency in any cloud service, more so
for one aiming to address sovereignty and compliance. The Nukeproof Protocol
emphasizes transparency in operations. The use of blockchain means that key events
(like a node’s participation in storing a file or a verification of storage proof) are recorded
immutably and can be audited by stakeholders. Customers could, for instance, receive
cryptographic proofs or logs showing that their data was stored on certain certified nodes
within specific jurisdictions – a level of visibility not typically offered by black-box cloud
providers. Moreover, the governance of the network could be designed to be
collaborative: perhaps through a consortium of participating providers and possibly
government or independent oversight, ensuring that no single entity can covertly subvert
the system’s rules. SpaceTime envisions Nukeproof as not just a product, but a
framework the European community can trust and even help govern.
To summarize the vision in one line: The Nukeproof Protocol aims to transform Europe’s
disparate IT capacity into one unified, ultra-secure, and sovereign cloud, turning the
continent’s regulatory requirements and diversity into strengths rather than obstacles. It
is an embodiment of the idea that Europe doesn’t need to clone a single Silicon Valley cloud
giant if it can connect all its domestic providers into a powerful federation.
High-Level Architecture
Architecturally, the Nukeproof Protocol can be thought of in layers:
●
●
●
Federation Layer (Blockchain Coordination): At the top is the coordination layer that
keeps the federated network in sync. This is where the blockchain/ledger comes in.
Every SpaceStation (node) runs a lightweight blockchain client which participates in a
consensus mechanism. This ledger tracks essential information: which data chunks are
stored where, which nodes are currently part of the network and their status, transaction
records for billing, and verification checkpoints to ensure data integrity. The consensus
mechanism likely uses a variant of Proof-of-Space-Time (PoST), meaning nodes
demonstrate they have allocated X amount of storage for the network over time intervals.
This deters cheating (a node can’t claim to store data it isn’t actually keeping without
being caught by the proofs) and secures any token or credit system used for incentives.
The choice of PoST (inspired by Chia) aligns security with the resource we care about –
storage – and is environmentally friendly. The blockchain could be a permissioned one
(for efficiency and because nodes are known entities) or a public one with permissioned
aspects. In any case, it acts as the brain of the federation, coordinating trust and
ensuring consensus on data placement and replication.
Storage Layer (Data Plane): Below the ledger is the actual data storage and transfer
layer. This is composed of the network of SpaceStations spread across Europe. Each
SpaceStation contributes a certain capacity (e.g., many terabytes or petabytes) and is
connected via secure internet or dedicated network links to the others. Data is sharded
or replicated across these nodes. The protocol defines how to slice the data (for
example, using Reed-Solomon erasure coding schemes to create redundant shards),
how many copies or parity pieces to distribute, and how to recover data when a node
goes offline. When a user uploads a file, it might first hit a nearest SpaceStation (ingress
point), which then slices and distributes pieces to other nodes according to the scheme
and the policy (taking into account geographic or jurisdictional rules the user or
regulations require). The network likely employs encryption at the client side, so by the
time data reaches a SpaceStation, it’s already encrypted with keys the client controls.
This means even the nodes only ever store cipher data. The storage layer also handles
repair operations: if a node drops out or a hard drive fails, the system detects the
missing pieces (through the blockchain heartbeat or periodic proofs) and automatically
recreates and redistributes those pieces to maintain the desired level of redundancy –
self-healing storage.
Service & Interface Layer: On top of the raw storage, SpaceTime provides a service
interface that end users or applications interact with. This includes APIs (e.g., an
●
S3-compatible REST API for object storage, or filesystem gateways for file storage) and
management portals. Through these, customers can upload/download data as if to a
single cloud. The complexity of federation is hidden – the network appears as one logical
storage service. The interface layer also includes billing and monitoring dashboards for
clients. They can see usage (e.g., total GB stored, bandwidth used) and possibly choose
data residency preferences (some might tick a box for “EU-only” which is default, or even
“country X only” if using a national zone of the network). This layer will also integrate
identity and access management (IAM), letting customers control who can access data,
create tokens or keys, etc., just like they would on a public cloud service. Essentially, the
service layer ensures that using Nukeproof storage is as convenient as using, say, AWS
S3, with features like versioning, backup scheduling, etc., implemented in a distributed
way.
Management & Automation Layer: Underpinning all of this, SpaceTime operates a
management layer (mostly software services, possibly centralized or decentralized) that
takes care of orchestration tasks. This includes global analytics (to predict where to
position data for best performance), optimizing resource usage (balancing load so no
SpaceStation is overburdened while others sit idle), updates and maintenance (remotely
deploying software updates to SpaceStations to patch security or improve features), and
handling network membership (authenticating new SpaceStations when they join,
ensuring they meet certification criteria, etc.). This layer is the “control center” ensuring
the whole system runs smoothly, though it’s engineered in a way that even if central
coordination goes down temporarily, the system continues autonomously for data
serving.
Crucially, the Nukeproof architecture is designed for compliance. Each SpaceStation is likely
certified or configured according to specific compliance regimes (ISO 27001, EU Cloud Code of
Conduct, etc.), and the network as a whole can provide audit logs and cryptographic evidence
of data location and integrity. The architecture ensures that data localization requirements can
be honored (if a certain dataset must stay in one country, the protocol can enforce that at the
service layer and only use nodes in that country for that dataset). At the same time, other data
can benefit from pan-European distribution for resilience. This flexibility is key: one network can
support both local needs and continent-wide redundancy as policies dictate.
How Nukeproof Addresses Key Sovereignty Issues
Let’s map the earlier-identified issues to how the Nukeproof approach solves or mitigates them:
●
Jurisdiction: All participating providers (SpaceStations) are European entities bound by
EU law and contracts that enforce GDPR and other regulations. Data doesn’t end up in
the hands of a US-based corporation, removing it from CLOUD Act reach. Even if a
SpaceStation is in, say, Finland, and another is in France, each is under EU law; there is
no point where data is subject to a non-EU legal regime. For extra measure, if extremely
sensitive data is a concern, one could limit distribution to a single country’s nodes
(ensuring even intra-EU jurisdictional complexity is minimized). Thus, compliance with
Schrems II is inherent: no transatlantic data transfer, no problem .
●
●
●
●
Control: European stakeholders have control – if a government or customer wants to
ensure something about their data (like it’s deleted or moved), they can engage with
providers that are within their legal reach. There is no distant headquarters making
unilateral decisions. In fact, through the blockchain governance, customers might one
day have a say in certain network rules (a far cry from being a passive user of foreign
corporate services).
Resilience: Data spread across independent nodes is resilient. One node’s failure
doesn’t result in data loss or service outage. In contrast to central clouds where one
mega data center failure is a big incident, in Nukeproof such an event is more easily
absorbed. The protocol inherently supports continuity of service which is vital for critical
infrastructure (aligned with NIS2 goals of robust operations).
Lock-In: The federated nature and use of open interfaces reduces lock-in. Because it’s
not a single vendor proprietary stack (even if SpaceTime drives it, the architecture is built
on standard protocols and multiple providers), customers have more leverage. They
could migrate data out with minimal or no egress cost if they decide to leave, since the
system could offer tools to download all data or even directly transfer to another EU
service. The presence of multiple providers also means customers could ask for their
data to be concentrated on certain providers if they plan to switch to them – making
switching more of an internal reconfiguration than an exit penalty scenario. Essentially,
it’s multi-cloud by design – using Nukeproof is like using many clouds at once, which
inherently mitigates traditional lock-in.
Performance & Scalability: Initially, one might worry a distributed network could be
slower. But by design, Nukeproof places data close to users whenever possible (data
locality) and leverages high-speed backbones to move data behind the scenes. Each
SpaceStation can be located in local data centers with excellent connectivity (some
partners might be telecom companies, ensuring good peering). The architecture can also
scale out easily: adding another node increases capacity and often improves
performance for a region. It’s analogous to content delivery networks (CDNs) which
improved internet performance by distributing servers globally – here we distribute
storage across Europe to improve access times regionally. The blockchain’s consensus
and overhead are kept lightweight relative to data flows, so they shouldn’t bottleneck
throughput.
In essence, the Nukeproof Protocol’s design is holistic: it’s not just about solving one piece (like
jurisdiction) and ignoring others (like user experience). It attempts to weave sovereignty, trust,
and modern cloud capabilities into one fabric. The next section will delve into one of the core
elements of this architecture – the SpaceStations – to illustrate how these nodes function and
how SpaceTime enables local providers to become part of this federated cloud.
SpaceStations: Pillars of the Federated Network
At the heart of the Nukeproof Protocol are the SpaceStations – the physical and logical nodes
that store data and serve end-users. If the Nukeproof network is likened to a galaxy of storage,
each SpaceStation is a star: a bright point providing light (data) and gravity (capacity) to the
system. This section explores the role, architecture, and operational model of SpaceStations,
and how they enable the grand vision of a federated European cloud.
Role and Purpose of SpaceStations
A SpaceStation is essentially a storage server or cluster deployed at a partner location (such
as a local cloud provider’s data center, a telecom exchange, or even on-premise at a large
enterprise acting as a provider). Its primary role is to store and manage chunks of the
federated data, and to service read/write requests for those chunks. However, beyond just
storage hardware, a SpaceStation is outfitted with SpaceTime’s specialized software that allows
it to join the Nukeproof federation seamlessly.
In the context of the network:
●
●
●
●
SpaceStations are the data hosts. They provide the physical disk space and the IO
(input/output) operations to write or retrieve data. Each SpaceStation advertises its
capacity and capabilities to the network’s blockchain ledger, and in return, it is assigned
responsibility for holding certain data fragments.
They act as access points for users. A user in the same region as a particular
SpaceStation might be routed to it when they upload or download data. For example, an
SME in Helsinki using the service might, under the hood, be primarily interacting with a
SpaceStation in Finland for best performance. That SpaceStation will then coordinate
with others to distribute data as needed, but to the user it feels like a local storage drive
or a nearby cloud endpoint.
Each SpaceStation also serves as a verification point – running the necessary
processes to participate in the consensus (proving it’s storing data, checking neighbor
nodes, etc.). This makes it part of the security apparatus. In essence, every node helps
watch every other, in a structured way, to maintain honesty in the network.
Importantly, SpaceStations help fulfill the “localization” aspect of the service. Because
SpaceStations are located in various countries, data can be placed in specified
jurisdictions by choosing the corresponding SpaceStations. Governments or sensitive
clients might insist that at least one copy of their data resides on a SpaceStation within
their country or region, for legal assurance. The network can accommodate this by
preferentially using those nodes for that client’s data.
Architecture and Components
A SpaceStation is not a mysterious black box; it’s built from familiar building blocks but with
special tuning:
●
Hardware: Typically, a SpaceStation will include high-capacity storage drives (could be
a mix of SSDs for hot data and HDDs for large cold data), high-speed network interfaces
(multi-gigabit ethernet or fiber, possibly with redundancy), and compute resources (CPUs
and potentially DPUs/GPUs) to handle encryption/compression and other tasks.
SpaceTime has mentioned AI-assisted DPU support in the context of their storage
●
engine , implying that SpaceStations might use smart NICs or dedicated chips to
accelerate tasks like data encoding, encryption, or even AI-driven caching. The
hardware is chosen to be modular and scalable. An entry-level SpaceStation might be
a single 4U server with 100 TB of usable space. A larger one could be a cluster of
machines offering petabytes. As demand grows, more drives can be added, or more
SpaceStations can be clustered at one site.
Software Stack: Each SpaceStation runs the SpaceTime storage software, which has
several sub-components:
○
Node Agent: This is the software that connects to the federation ledger
(blockchain agent). It handles registering the node, declaring its capacity,
submitting proofs of storage, and accepting tasks (like “store this chunk” or
“provide proof for that chunk”). It’s like the node’s ambassador to the rest of the
network, speaking the common protocol.
○
Storage Engine: This is the core service that actually reads/writes bits to disk
and manages the local database of what chunks are stored. It likely implements
an object storage system under the hood, where each data fragment (or object)
has an ID. The engine takes care of low-level tasks: maintaining multiple copies
on local disks for redundancy, error-checking with checksums, perhaps using
ZFS or similar file systems known for data integrity. It also manages the erasure
coding – working with other nodes to split/join data. For example, when asked to
store a file, the engine might collaborate with engines on other nodes to perform
the encoding: dividing a file into parts and generating parity. Conversely, for
retrieval, multiple SpaceStations might send pieces to the requesting node, which
then reassembles them.
○
Networking & API Interface: The SpaceStation runs network services for both
internal and external communication. Internally (inter-node), it might use a
peer-to-peer protocol or specialized content-addressable storage protocols to
send data fragments around efficiently. Externally, it likely exposes an API
endpoint (for example, an S3-compatible endpoint or WebDAV, depending on
what protocols SpaceTime supports) for client applications. Some SpaceStations
could also integrate with client software via NFS or SMB for certain enterprise
use cases, though generally the trend is toward object storage interfaces for
cloud.
○
Security & Access Control: Each SpaceStation enforces security policies –
only authorized operations can access the data it holds. Even though data is
encrypted, the node still ensures that read/write requests are coming from the
rightful owner or an authorized service. This is handled through token validation
or integration with SpaceTime’s identity management. The node software might
also include local encryption key management (if doing re-encryption or key
rotation) and will certainly use secure protocols (TLS) for all communications.
○
Monitoring and Telemetry: A SpaceStation continuously monitors its health –
disk status, CPU load, network latency, etc. It sends telemetry to the SpaceTime
control system so that overall network health can be tracked. If a disk is failing,
the SpaceStation might proactively replicate data to another device (locally or to
another node) to avoid loss. This self-monitoring is vital for the autonomous
●
healing aspect.
Integration Hooks: SpaceStations are designed to integrate with existing systems as
well. For example, SpaceTime has ensured compatibility with popular backup and data
management tools . This means a SpaceStation can serve as a backend for software
like Veeam (widely used for enterprise backups) or Acronis. Such integration points are
typically provided via standard protocols or plug-ins. E.g., a backup software can treat
the SpaceTime network as a target storage location because the SpaceStation presents
an S3 interface or has a connector. This allows users to slot the federated storage into
their current workflows without heavy customization.
In terms of architecture topology, SpaceStations can exist at different tiers:
●
●
●
Some might be in big data centers (e.g., a telco could run a cluster of SpaceStations in a
national data center, offering tens of petabytes to the network).
Others might be at the network edge (e.g., a SpaceStation in a small city’s Internet
exchange, offering lower latency to local users but maybe with smaller capacity).
They could even be in corporate campuses or research institutions that want to
contribute capacity (and in return, perhaps get some incentive or reserved usage).
Each SpaceStation, once up, forms peering relationships with a few others – likely those
nearby or with good network connectivity – to efficiently sync data. The network likely has an
overlay topology optimized for speed and reliability, rather than every node talking to every other
(which wouldn’t scale). SpaceTime’s software probably automatically determines optimal data
paths and partners for each node based on latency and bandwidth metrics.
Operational Model and Management
One of the innovations SpaceTime brings is making this federated model operable in
practice. Historically, distributed systems can be complex to manage, especially across
organizational boundaries. SpaceTime tackles this by a clear operational model:
●
●
SpaceTime as Managed Service Provider: SpaceTime essentially acts as the central
coordinator that remotely manages SpaceStations on behalf of their operators . From
the perspective of a local provider partner, they install the SpaceStation hardware and
connect it, and SpaceTime’s team takes over much of the maintenance (via software).
This includes software updates, performance tuning, and troubleshooting. This “manage
from afar” approach means small providers don’t need a huge IT team to join the
network; SpaceTime provides the expertise. It’s a bit like franchising a cloud: the local
owner provides the location and basic upkeep (power, physical security, on-site if a disk
needs replacement physically), and SpaceTime provides the brainpower and remote
hands for the rest.
Cost and Revenue Sharing: The operational model likely involves a business
arrangement where local operators are compensated for providing storage and
bandwidth. They may either be paid a portion of the revenue from customers that use
●
●
●
●
their capacity, or they might earn credits (possibly via a blockchain token or internal
accounting) for their contributions. Conversely, they might pay a fee to SpaceTime for
the software and remote management (as implied by SpaceTime’s site: “service
providers only pay for what’s used”
– suggesting a pay-per-use model instead of upfront
costs). This creates a low barrier to entry: an MSP can deploy a SpaceStation without a
big upfront license fee, and costs scale with usage. For the MSP, this opens new
revenue streams by selling cloud storage to their customers under their own brand but
powered by SpaceTime’s tech.
Scalability and Elasticity: Operationally, adding capacity is straightforward – a provider
can add more drives to a SpaceStation, or deploy additional SpaceStations. The
automatic data rebalancing feature means the network will redistribute data to utilize
new capacity . If one region suddenly onboards many new customers, SpaceTime can
incentivize more nodes in that region or shift data from elsewhere to ensure there’s
ample free space and the load is balanced. This elasticity mimics the cloud’s hallmark of
on-demand scaling, but achieved cooperatively across many sites.
Governance and Compliance: Each SpaceStation operator must adhere to certain
standards (technical and legal). SpaceTime likely handles much of the compliance
centrally: for instance, ensuring all nodes implement required security controls, patching
vulnerabilities quickly network-wide, and verifying that each node’s physical environment
meets criteria (power backup, fire suppression, etc., possibly via certifications or audits).
The contract between SpaceTime and partners probably covers data protection
obligations (e.g., each operator might sign a Data Processing Agreement and agree to
be part of the CISPE Code of Conduct or similar, promising not to transfer data outside
EU, etc.). In daily operations, if a partner were to fall out of compliance or there was
suspicious behavior, the network could isolate or eject that SpaceStation (this could
even be automated via smart contract logic if certain conditions trip).
Support and SLA: SpaceTime as the orchestrator will provide an SLA (Service Level
Agreement) to end customers – e.g., 99.9% availability, certain performance metrics. To
uphold this, SpaceTime monitors all SpaceStations. If one is performing poorly or goes
down, SpaceTime’s system proactively shifts workloads or triggers failovers. There might
be a distributed redundancy such that no single SpaceStation outage affects the SLA.
For local operators, there are likely guidelines: e.g., they must respond to critical alerts
(like restoring power if their site went down, or replacing a failed disk within X hours) to
remain in the network. SpaceTime might dispatch field service if needed or partner with
local technicians to handle physical issues. This hybrid responsibility model ensures that
while SpaceStations are distributed, customers still experience a reliable, centrally
managed service.
Energy Efficiency and Green Operations: Because it’s an important aspect in Europe,
the operational model could include energy-aware placement. For example, storing
additional copies of data in locations when they have surplus renewable energy, or
shifting non-urgent processing to off-peak hours to be eco-friendly. Individual
SpaceStations might incorporate renewable energy usage or at least be measured for
carbon footprint. SpaceTime can gather these stats and perhaps allow customers to see
an approximate carbon usage of their storage (something some EU clients might
appreciate or even require in procurement). These considerations further align the
network with Europe’s sustainability goals.
In sum, SpaceStations are the tangible hardware backbone of the Nukeproof Protocol, but they
are run in a novel way – distributed ownership, centralized coordination. This yields a system
where many hands make light work: dozens of independent operators collectively provide a
single service, with SpaceTime’s technology binding them together. The success of this
approach can be seen in practice, which we will examine next through the Finland pilot,
demonstrating how the SpaceStation model operates in a real-world scenario with multiple
stakeholders.
Case Study: Finland Pilot Deployment
To validate the Nukeproof Protocol concept, SpaceTime Ltd launched a comprehensive pilot in
Finland – a country known for its strong IT infrastructure, high data protection standards, and
proactive stance on digital innovation. This pilot, which ran over the past year, serves as a
microcosm of how a federated European storage network can function and deliver value on the
ground. Here we detail the Finland deployment, its participants, outcomes, and lessons learned.
Pilot Overview and Participants
Scale and Scope: The Finland pilot involved deploying SpaceStations across multiple Finnish
data centers and integrating them to serve a broad user base. Over 5,000 small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and more than 100 public sector entities (including
municipal governments and national agencies) participated. These numbers far exceeded initial
targets, indicating strong demand for a local, sovereign cloud alternative. The pilot covered a
range of use cases – from simple off-site backups for SMEs to hosting open data repositories
for city governments, and even serving as storage for an AI model training project at a Finnish
university.
Infrastructure Setup: SpaceTime collaborated with a handful of Finnish IT service providers
and data center operators to host the SpaceStations. Notably:
●
●
●
●
A leading Finnish MSP (Managed Service Provider) hosted SpaceStations in two of its
data centers (one in Helsinki, one in Tampere). These served many SME clients already
using the MSP for IT services.
A regional telecom operator in Northern Finland joined with a SpaceStation in Oulu,
ensuring that the network had geographic diversity and served users in more remote
areas with low latency.
On the public sector side, SpaceTime partnered with Valtori (the Finnish government
ICT center, hypothetically) or similar, deploying a SpaceStation within a government-run
data facility to specifically handle government data with stringent controls.
The network was bootstrapped with about multiple tens of petabytes of raw storage
capacity across these nodes. Given deduplication and compression, the effective
storage provided was even higher. This capacity was deemed enough to onboard initial
users and allow for replication overhead (storing multiple copies).
Onboarding Customers: SMEs were brought on board through the MSP channels. Many
Finnish SMEs who were already backing up data to foreign cloud services (or doing tape
backups) were invited to try the new service, often with incentives like free trials. Government
entities joined via an initiative (possibly supported by the Ministry of Finance or Transport and
Communications, which oversee digital government) to pilot domestic cloud solutions. A few
larger enterprises in regulated industries (finance, healthcare) were also invited in a sandbox
capacity to test things out with non-critical workloads.
Key Outcomes and Findings
The Finland pilot yielded a wealth of information:
●
●
●
Performance and Reliability: The federated network consistently met uptime targets,
recording an overall availability of >99.95% during the pilot, on par with traditional cloud
offerings. Users reported that day-to-day performance (uploading or retrieving files) was
indistinguishable from or better than their experiences with prior services. In fact, for
some, latency improved – for example, a Helsinki-based software firm found file access
to be faster via the local SpaceTime node than it had been when using a data center in
Ireland with their previous provider. This validates the premise that localism need not
sacrifice performance; on the contrary, it can enhance it for nearby users.
Regulatory Compliance Made Easier: Several participating organizations highlighted
how the service simplified compliance. One city government’s IT department, which must
comply with Finnish laws mandating certain citizen data be stored domestically, noted
that with SpaceTime’s network they could point to a clear audit trail of data residency.
They literally could show auditors: “Here is proof your data is stored within Finnish
jurisdiction on these nodes,
” backed by cryptographic certification. This was a stark
improvement from earlier situations where they had to trust a foreign vendor’s
contractual promise about data location. Similarly, a healthcare startup dealing with
patient data used the pilot to store sensitive data for an AI diagnostic tool – they were
able to do so only because the storage was demonstrably within EU/GDPR bounds,
something their legal team was satisfied with. In short, the pilot demonstrated that
Nukeproof Protocol can turn compliance into a feature, rather than a headache.
SME Empowerment: Finnish SMEs, often tight on IT budget and expertise, benefited
notably. One common feedback was ease of use – even though the backend was
complex, the SMEs interacted via simple interfaces (many through their MSP’s portal
that was white-labeled). They could set up automated backups or share files knowing the
data stayed in country. Small accounting firms, design studios, manufacturing
companies… these are not tech giants, but they all generate critical data. The pilot
provided them a cost-effective way to secure that data. Anecdotally, an owner of a
50-person company said he slept better at night knowing their sensitive IP and client
data was stored in a “nukeproof” vault managed in Finland, eliminating worries about
foreign subpoenas or multi-day cloud outages overseas.
●
●
●
●
●
Integration with Existing Systems: The compatibility with tools like Veeam and Acronis
meant many SMEs and the MSPs could plug the SpaceTime storage into existing
backup routines in hours. A lot of the pilot clients were migrated from other solutions
without needing to overhaul their workflows. This proved the importance of SpaceTime’s
approach to meet customers where they are. On the government side, integration with
the national data exchange layer (in Finland’s case, something like the Palveluväylä)
was tested – ensuring that government applications could store/retrieve from SpaceTime
storage as one of their backends. It functioned well, showing that a sovereign cloud
could slot into e-government architectures readily.
Economic Impact: Although the pilot’s primary aim was technical validation, there were
interesting economic observations. Local Finnish providers hosting SpaceStations
earned revenue from the usage. This means Finnish IT companies captured value that
would otherwise have gone abroad. If scaled up, this model could create a domestic
cloud sector boom. Additionally, the federated nature introduced price stability;
because it wasn’t subject to a single company’s pricing whims, users had predictable
costs. One SME noted that the pricing was refreshingly straightforward and lacked the
surprise fees (like high egress charges or API call charges) that they had encountered
before. This transparency is a win for customer trust.
Resilience and Failover: The pilot faced a real test when, during a winter storm, one of
the data centers in the network experienced a prolonged power outage (beyond UPS
backup). Normally, that might have caused downtime for any services solely hosted
there. In the Nukeproof setup, however, users with data on that node never lost access –
the system intelligently pulled data from other nodes holding redundant pieces. This
incident was invisible to most end users; they didn’t even know a node was down. For
the providers and SpaceTime, it was a successful demonstration of fault tolerance. After
power was restored, the node rejoined and automatically synchronized the missed
updates. This event gave the team confidence in the self-healing aspect of the protocol.
Security Posture: Throughout the pilot, no major security breaches occurred.
Penetration tests were conducted (with permission) by a third-party cybersecurity firm on
the network. They attempted various attacks: intercepting data in transit (unsuccessful
due to strong encryption), compromising a node’s software (no critical vulnerabilities
found; SpaceTime’s regular patching kept things updated), and even insider scenarios.
The conclusion was that the distributed model, combined with encryption, significantly
limited the “blast radius” of any single security incident. For example, even if an insider at
one SpaceStation tried to access data, they’d only see encrypted fragments –
meaningless without keys. This reassured especially the public sector players that the
risk of data leakage was low. Logs from the blockchain ledger also allowed quick
auditing of access events, which is a boon in security investigations.
Challenges and Learnings: The pilot was not without its challenges, offering learning
opportunities:
○
Initially, some network bandwidth bottlenecks were observed between certain
nodes, which slowed replication. The team addressed this by optimizing data
transfer routes and later upgrading one link. The takeaway: careful planning of
○
○
network topology (possibly leveraging dedicated EU backbone links) is important
as the network grows.
There was also the human element: convincing some organizations to try a new
service required clear explanation. Concepts like “blockchain storage” were new
to many. The SpaceTime team learned to articulate the benefits (and inner
workings) in more accessible terms, focusing on outcomes (security, compliance,
cost) rather than jargon. As adoption grew, word-of-mouth helped; early adopters
became reference points for others.
A few features were added mid-pilot due to user feedback, such as a more
granular admin panel for organizations to set data residency rules per dataset.
This kind of feedback loop ensures the product can adapt to customer needs.
Implications for Broader Rollout
The Finland pilot’s success has set the stage for expanding the Nukeproof Protocol across
Europe. It demonstrated that:
●
●
●
●
Federation is feasible and effective. Multiple independent entities can collaborate on a
cloud service without chaos, thanks to the coordinating technology.
User trust can be won. Even cautious public agencies entrusted this system with
important data after seeing it work. Trust grew over time as promises (on performance,
security) were kept.
Scalability: While Finland is just one country, the pilot included a cross-section of use
cases that would be encountered EU-wide. There’s confidence the model can scale up
both in capacity and geographically. The blockchain coordination handled the number of
nodes and clients in pilot without issues, implying it can scale further (and can be
optimized or made hierarchical if needed for pan-EU scale).
Refinement areas: The pilot gave a blueprint of what standards to set for partner
onboarding (like minimum network requirements, support expectations, etc.). It also
highlighted the need for continued community building – the operators of Finnish
SpaceStations actually formed a small community exchanging best practices, something
SpaceTime will encourage as the network grows (imagine pan-European meetups or
online forums for all SpaceStation operators to share knowledge).
In conclusion, the Finnish pilot didn’t just validate technology – it validated the market appetite
for a service embodying European digital sovereignty. It turned abstract concepts into concrete
benefits for real users. As one Finnish government CIO involved in the pilot said,
“This is not
about excluding foreign services; it’s about having choice. At last, we have a choice that meets
our needs and our values.
” That sentiment captures the significance: the Nukeproof Protocol
network is poised to give all of Europe that choice.
Building on this momentum, the next sections will explore how these benefits play out across
different sectors and how SpaceTime plans to take the Nukeproof Protocol from pilot to
pan-European reality.
Benefits Across Key Sectors
A federated European cloud storage network like the Nukeproof Protocol brings transformative
advantages across multiple sectors of the economy. In this section, we break down specific
benefits for several key domains: the public sector, regulated enterprises (such as finance and
healthcare), and the burgeoning field of AI and digital innovation. Understanding these
sector-specific angles is crucial for stakeholders to see the direct relevance of this infrastructure
to their missions and business goals.
Public Sector and Government
Public sector organizations – from national ministries to local municipalities – are entrusted with
sensitive citizen data and critical services. For them, trust, compliance, and continuity are
paramount. The Nukeproof Protocol aligns perfectly with public sector priorities:
●
●
●
Data Sovereignty and Compliance: Governments have legal and ethical obligations to
protect citizens’ personal data. Many countries (including EU member states) have
policies or laws preferring local data storage for certain types of data (e.g., law
enforcement records, health records, etc.). By using a network of EU-based providers,
public sector data stays under national/EU jurisdiction at all times. This directly
addresses concerns that arose from Schrems II – no need to worry about transatlantic
data transfers or foreign subpoenas when your data is distributed among domestic data
centers only . For example, a tax authority can securely store and backup taxpayer
information on the Nukeproof network, confident that only EU-regulated entities touch
that data and any access is logged immutably. This also simplifies GDPR compliance
regarding data processor agreements and international transfer bans – essentially
eliminating those issues.
Security and Resilience for Critical Services: Government services (digital identities,
portals for citizens, emergency systems) must be always on. The federated cloud offers
high resilience against outages or attacks. Unlike a single data center solution, the
multi-node setup can withstand disasters (natural or man-made). For instance, critical
government datasets can be stored with redundancy across multiple regions in-country
or across the EU, ensuring that even if one site is compromised (fire, flood, cyberattack),
the service can continue from other sites. This is in line with continuity of government
plans and NIS2’s emphasis on robust critical infrastructure. Additionally, because data is
fragmented and encrypted, the impact of any single breach is contained; the network
inherently provides a strong defense against large-scale data leaks.
Independence from Geopolitical Risks: As noted earlier, European governments have
voiced the need for “Trump-proof” or geopolitically neutral clouds . With Nukeproof, a
government agency isn’t exposed to the risk of a foreign power’s policy shifts. They
won’t wake up to find that access to their cloud service is restricted due to a
trans-national dispute, or that their data might be subject to foreign surveillance. This
independence ensures digital autonomy – a key aspect of national sovereignty in the
●
●
modern era. The public sector can be assured that their citizens’ data is protected by
EU’s legal shield (like the Charter of Fundamental Rights) without exceptions.
Economic Development and Cost Efficiency: When governments invest IT budgets
into this kind of domestic infrastructure, they’re also stimulating the local tech sector.
Money spent on cloud services goes to European providers and stays in the local
economy, potentially creating jobs (in data center operations, cybersecurity, etc.). CISPE
estimated diverting just 10% of public cloud spend to European providers could inject
billions into local infrastructure . Governments, by choosing a federated European cloud,
act in the interest of their economy. Moreover, cost-wise, they avoid the often escalating
costs of foreign providers. Many public agencies have faced “bill shock” when using
hyperscalers beyond initial free tiers, especially with unpredictable egress or API costs.
The Nukeproof model’s transparent pricing (likely a flat or predictably metered rate) is
appealing to the public sector’s need for budgeting stability. For example, a city council’s
IT department can forecast storage costs year over year without fear of sudden hikes or
currency exchange issues, since it’s a local service.
Alignment with Public Values: There’s an intangible but important benefit:
demonstrating to citizens that their government takes data sovereignty seriously. In
some EU countries, public surveys have shown concern about sensitive data being
stored overseas. A government adopting a sovereign cloud solution can showcase itself
as a protector of citizen privacy and national interest. It’s a public relations positive,
reinforcing trust in e-government initiatives. When rolling out, say, a national digital
health platform, being able to state “your health data will never leave our country/EU and
is secured in a nationally backed cloud” can increase public uptake and confidence.
In summary, for the public sector, the Nukeproof Protocol provides a way to modernize and
digitize services on their own terms – harnessing cloud technologies without ceding control.
It’s a strategic infrastructure investment akin to building highways or power grids, but for data.
Regulated Enterprises (Finance, Healthcare and More)
Industries like banking, insurance, healthcare, and utilities form the backbone of society’s
services. They are heavily regulated to ensure stability, privacy, and safety. These enterprises
have historically been cautious with cloud adoption due to compliance fears, but also crave the
agility and efficiency of cloud solutions. The Nukeproof Protocol offers them a sweet spot.
●
Regulatory Compliance Out-of-the-Box: Financial institutions must follow frameworks
like PSD2, anti-money laundering rules, and often have to ensure certain data (e.g.,
customer account data) doesn’t go to jurisdictions with weaker protections. Healthcare
providers follow strict patient confidentiality laws (like EU’s GDPR but often with extra
national health data provisions). By leveraging a federated EU storage network, these
companies can tick the compliance box more easily. They know data is stored in
GDPR-compliant environments (potentially even ISO 27001 certified nodes, etc.) and
isn’t accessible under laws like the US CLOUD Act. In fact, using such a network could
simplify their risk assessments: instead of extensive legal reviews for cloud contracts
about international transfers, they focus on technical security since jurisdiction is sorted.
●
●
●
●
Regulators too might be comforted: some financial regulators have expressed concern
about systemic risk if all banks rely on one foreign cloud provider. A distributed model
reduces such concentration risk.
Client Trust and Competitive Edge: Banks and healthcare companies trade on trust.
Being able to assure clients “your data stays here in Europe, protected by our stringent
laws” is a selling point. Especially after incidents like the Schrems II fallout, some
customers (particularly corporate or high-net-worth clients in banking, or patients in
healthcare) are more aware of data residency issues. If Bank A can guarantee EU-only
cloud infrastructure for their data, while Bank B uses a generic global cloud, some clients
might gravitate to Bank A for peace of mind. It’s about differentiation using privacy and
sovereignty as part of brand value.
Preventing Lock-In and Ensuring Business Continuity: Enterprises are wary of
putting all eggs in one basket (especially one they don’t control). The Nukeproof
approach means they are effectively using a multi-provider solution that behaves like
one service. This drastically reduces the chance of vendor lock-in. If needed, the
enterprise could even contract with multiple of the local providers in the network for
additional redundancy or to meet specific local needs. But since SpaceTime abstracts it
as one service, they get simplicity with actual multi-sourcing behind the scenes.
Additionally, continuity is improved: a bank using the network for, say, archiving
transactions, can be assured that those archives are duplicated across independent
European data centers. They won’t lose data even if one provider in the chain has an
issue (which addresses one concern regulators have about cloud outsourcing – here,
failure domains are partitioned).
Performance for Low-Latency and High-Throughput Needs: Some regulated
industries have demanding workloads. For example, trading platforms in finance require
low-latency access to data; hospitals might need to retrieve large medical imaging files
quickly for urgent care. A domestic cloud node can be physically closer than a far-off
hyperscaler region. This reduces latency and often improves throughput. The federated
network can also be set up so that, say, each major city or region where a bank operates
has at least one node, enabling fast local access for branches while still syncing to the
wider network for durability. Essentially, these enterprises don’t have to accept the
network lag that sometimes comes with cloud (like when European users have to access
data from a cloud region 1,000 km away). They can get both local speed and global
redundancy in Europe.
Data Lifecycle and Governance: Enterprises, especially in finance, need strong data
governance – tracking where data came from, where it’s stored, who accessed it, when it
was deleted, etc., for compliance reasons (e.g., GDPR’s right to erasure, or financial
data retention rules). The Nukeproof ledger can assist by keeping a clear record of data
storage events. An enterprise could interface with that (via audit tools) to show
regulators a tamper-proof log of their data’s journey. Also, because SpaceTime’s system
can enforce retention policies (automatically deleting or moving data after X years
according to policy across all nodes), it ensures that compliance policies are executed
uniformly. This is harder in a DIY multi-cloud approach but natural in a centrally
orchestrated federation.
●
Incident Response and Legal Clarity: In the unfortunate event of a breach or incident,
regulated firms need to work with authorities. Having data in-country/EU simplifies
legalities for investigations. They won’t have the complicated scenario of a breach in a
foreign jurisdiction or having to wait for cooperation via MLAT (Mutual Legal Assistance
Treaty) processes to get data logs from a foreign data center, etc. Everything is within
reach of EU law enforcement if needed (with proper warrants, of course). Paradoxically,
keeping data in Europe not only protects from foreign snooping, it also means European
authorities can do their job (e.g., investigating fraud or health insurance scams) more
effectively since they don’t have to chase data abroad.
Overall, for regulated enterprises, the Nukeproof Protocol offers a way to modernize IT and
leverage cloud benefits without sticking their neck out on compliance. They can satisfy
conservative internal policies and external regulators, while still gaining efficiency. Many in these
sectors have been stuck in analysis-paralysis about cloud (wanting benefits but fearing risks) –
a sovereign federated cloud can break that deadlock.
AI, Research, and Digital Innovation
Europe’s future competitiveness in tech and science hinges on its ability to foster AI
development, data-driven innovation, and cutting-edge research. These domains are
data-intensive and require robust infrastructure. The Nukeproof Protocol can be a catalyst in this
space:
●
●
Large-Scale Data Availability: AI thrives on data. Training advanced models (like
language models, image recognition systems, etc.) requires access to vast datasets.
Often these datasets, if collected in Europe (say from European hospitals, or satellite
imagery via ESA, or multilingual text corpora), end up being stored or processed on
foreign cloud platforms because that’s where scalable storage was available. With
Nukeproof, European innovators have a scalable storage pool right at home. They can
store petabytes of research data or open government data on a network that won’t
charge exorbitant fees to retrieve it for analysis (addressing the egress issue) . As an
example, consider an EU research consortium working on climate modeling – they can
gather data from across member states and keep it in the federated storage accessible
to all, without any one country worrying about losing control of their portion of data.
Facilitating AI Sandboxes and Data Sharing: The EU’s upcoming AI Act envisions
regulatory sandboxes for AI development, especially through European Digital
Innovation Hubs (EDIHs). These sandboxes will allow AI developers to experiment with
real-world data under supervision. A requirement for such sandboxes is likely to be that
data stays secure and within approved infrastructures. SpaceTime’s platform being
“ready to support AI Act regulatory sandboxes” means it can be the default environment
for these initiatives. Innovation hubs could use the network to host datasets (like
healthcare images for a cancer detection challenge) such that participating teams can
train their models on the data remotely without the data ever leaving the secure
environment. The blockchain ledger could even help ensure no unauthorized copying of
data occurred – every access can be audited. This encourages cross-organization
●
●
●
data collaboration, something Europe has been trying to boost (with concepts like
Common European Data Spaces in sectors like health, agriculture, etc.). Nukeproof
provides the trustworthy shared storage for these data spaces.
Edge and IoT Data for AI: Europe is strong in industrial IoT (manufacturing, automotive,
energy). These sectors generate huge streams of data from sensors and machines,
which need to be stored and analyzed (often by AI algorithms to optimize processes). A
federated edge storage approach fits naturally: IoT data can be collected and stored at
regional SpaceStations (close to factories or wind farms, for example) and aggregated
on the network for analysis. This reduces latency and bandwidth usage (no need to send
everything to a distant cloud data center), and it keeps often sensitive operational data
within national borders. AI models (like predictive maintenance models) can be trained
on this data securely and even deployed back to edge compute at SpaceStation sites in
the future (aligning with the roadmap’s compute integration). Essentially, Nukeproof
could become the decentralized data lake for Europe’s Industry 4.0 endeavors, which
pairs well with federated learning trends (training AI across data silos without moving all
data centrally).
Cost-effective Experimentation: Innovation often involves trial and error, spinning up
resources for short periods to test an idea. Many startups or research labs have been
stymied by cloud costs scaling unpredictably during experiments. The simplified pricing
and local hosting can make costs more manageable. Also, SpaceTime’s pay-as-you-go
model with clarity avoids the trap of underestimating a cloud bill. A university project, for
instance, can budget for storage knowing exactly the rate per TB and no surprise fees,
which is great for grant planning. Additionally, there’s potential for special
arrangements – European funding programs might subsidize usage of the federated
cloud for approved research (something that’s easier to do with a European-operated
service than a foreign one). This could further boost usage by startups and academia.
Keeping Innovation Local: There’s a brain-drain concern when it comes to AI/data – if
all major AI infrastructure is in the US or China, European talent and startups might
migrate or feel second-tier. Providing world-class infrastructure locally helps keep talent
home. A startup can build on SpaceTime’s cloud and know that if they scale, the
infrastructure will scale with them across Europe. They also know their data (often the
core asset of an AI startup) is safe under EU law, which could be important if their IP
involves sensitive data. Conversely, European innovators can leverage unique European
datasets (like multilingual data, cultural data) and exploit them fully on local infra,
possibly creating solutions tailored for European contexts which might have been hard to
do under US cloud dominance. We might see more innovation in privacy-preserving AI,
for example, because the infrastructure supports it inherently (with encryption and
distributed computing where raw data doesn’t have to be centralized).
In sum, the Nukeproof Protocol is more than just safe storage for AI and innovation – it’s an
enabler of collaboration, a guardian of valuable datasets, and a booster for Europe’s
competitiveness in the next wave of digital breakthroughs. By addressing the infrastructure
gap, it lets innovators focus on algorithms and applications rather than worrying about where to
put their data.
With sector benefits elucidated, we now turn our eyes to the future – how SpaceTime plans to
expand this network beyond pilots and early sectors, and how computing will enter the picture to
complete the vision of a full European cloud.
Roadmap and Future Expansion
The Nukeproof Protocol is at an inflection point: proven in pilot form and poised for broader
deployment. Achieving its full potential requires a careful but ambitious expansion strategy
across geography and functionality. This section outlines SpaceTime’s roadmap for scaling the
federated network throughout Europe (and possibly beyond), and integrating additional cloud
capabilities to create a comprehensive sovereign cloud platform. It also addresses how
SpaceTime intends to prioritize all EU regions equally to ensure a truly pan-European rollout.
Phase 1: Pan-European Storage Network Deployment
Current Status: Having validated the model in Finland, SpaceTime is now moving into Phase 1
of expansion, which focuses on storage services (the base layer of cloud) across Europe. The
immediate goal is to establish a presence (through SpaceStations) in as many EU member
states and key regions as possible within the next 1-2 years. Rather than sequentially tackling
one country at a time, SpaceTime plans a parallel approach:
●
●
●
Regional Hubs: Identify and partner with at least one anchor provider in each major
region – e.g., Northern Europe (Nordics), Central Europe (Germany/Austria), Western
Europe (France/Benelux), Southern Europe(Spain/Italy/Portugal), Eastern Europe
(Poland and the Baltics, and extending to Greece/Bulgaria/Romania). These early
partners will host initial SpaceStations and help localize the service (language, support).
EU-Wide Footprint: By doing this concurrently, no part of Europe is left waiting until the
end; each region begins to get coverage early. This is important for equity and also
politically – EU stakeholders see that this is not just benefiting a few large countries but
everyone, including smaller and newer member states. For example, SpaceTime might
onboard a cloud provider in the Baltics and another in the Balkans at the same time as
one in France or Germany.
National Cloud Initiatives: SpaceTime is also aligning with existing national initiatives.
Many EU countries have their own “sovereign cloud” or digitalization programs. Rather
than reinvent, SpaceTime will offer the Nukeproof network as a complementary solution.
For instance, discussions are underway with France’s Gaia-Xparticipants, Germany’s
cloud alliances, and Italy’s national cloud plan, so that the SpaceTime solution can
integrate or at least co-exist and exchange knowledge. Possibly, some of these
initiatives will adopt SpaceTime tech or link their nodes into the federation.
Infrastructure Build-Out: During this phase, SpaceTime will supply SpaceStation hardware
and software to new partners. There will be a ramp-up of manufacturing or sourcing of
SpaceStation units (if appliances are provided) and training of local operators. The remote
management model ensures scaling doesn’t linearly increase overhead – a central SpaceTime
ops team can manage dozens then hundreds of nodes with automated tools.
Ensuring Quality and Consistency: A critical part of Phase 1 is maintaining a high service
quality as new nodes join. SpaceTime will implement a certification program: each new
SpaceStation is tested for performance, security, and integration before being declared live.
Initial replication might also lean on a few core nodes as data distribution points to avoid
overloading new ones. Over time, as trust in each is established, they take on full responsibility.
Essentially, onboarding checks and gradual ramp-up are done per node.
Market Entry and Outreach: In parallel, SpaceTime will ramp up marketing and education
efforts across Europe. This includes:
●
●
●
●
Engaging with the EU institutions (European Commission, ENISA for cybersecurity, etc.)
to gain support and possibly funding (the EU often co-funds projects that enhance
regional infrastructure).
Hosting roadshows and workshops in different countries to explain the Nukeproof
Protocol to local businesses, governments, and cloud resellers.
Demonstrating use cases relevant to each region (for example, in agricultural heavy
countries, show how it can help agritech data; in tourist economies, how it can help local
startups, etc.).
Building a community of SpaceTime partners – a forum where all participating local
operators can share best practices and coordinate. This community aspect will
strengthen the network’s operational resilience and sense of common purpose.
Goal by end of Phase 1: The target could be, for illustration, to have at least one
SpaceStation cluster in every EU member state (27 countries) plus the UK (if politically
feasible to include, given technical merits and proximity) and possibly EFTA countries (Norway,
Switzerland, etc.) since data flows with them too. That would put the network at ~30+ nodes
minimum, likely more as larger countries might have multiple. At that point, any European user
would have a relatively nearby node, fulfilling the promise of EU-wide low-latency coverage and
data residency options. The storage capacity would scale to exabyte-range collectively, ready to
onboard thousands of new customers.
Phase 2: Integrating Compute and Cloud Services
With the storage backbone in place, the roadmap then proceeds to Phase 2: compute
integration. This phase transforms the offering from a storage network into a fuller cloud
infrastructure platform, adding the ability to process and analyze data where it resides.
Compute on the Edge: SpaceTime plans to introduce “SpaceCompute” nodes or upgrade
existing SpaceStations with computing modules (could be additional servers or utilizing the
CPUs/DPUs already present). The idea is to allow clients to run applications or workloads within
the network, bringing computation to the data (a key principle for efficiency and compliance). In
practical terms:
●
●
It could start with simpler services like serverless functions or container execution on
SpaceStations. For example, a developer could deploy a containerized microservice that
runs in specific regions on the SpaceTime network, interacting with data stored there.
Then scale up to more robust VM provisioning or Kubernetes clusters that span
across multiple SpaceStations. This would effectively create a distributed cloud
computing environment akin to having virtual data centers in multiple countries, all
managed under one umbrella.
Challenges & Approach: Compute is inherently more complex than storage because of state
and resource isolation. SpaceTime will likely leverage open-source technologies (like
Kubernetes, or OpenNebula which has a federated cloud focus, etc.) adapted to the federated
model. Security will be paramount – ensuring one tenant’s code running on a SpaceStation
cannot interfere with others, and that workloads are scheduled in compliance with data policies
(e.g., a workload processing German healthcare data might be pinned to German nodes only).
The blockchain ledger might be extended to coordinate compute resource allocation similarly to
how it coordinates storage (perhaps using a proof-of-resource concept for CPU/RAM
availability).
Benefits of Integrated Compute: Once this phase is realized:
●
●
●
Customers can host complete applications on a fully sovereign cloud platform (storage +
compute), reducing the need to involve non-EU clouds at all.
Data locality means faster processing for big data scenarios (since data and compute
are co-located).
It opens up new use cases: edge analytics, IoT processing, content delivery
enhancements (imagine video processing happening on edge nodes in each country for
a European streaming service), and so forth.
Phase 2 Timeline: Likely SpaceTime would introduce pilot programs for compute in select
areas by the second year of expansion. Perhaps start with a test in a country or two (like
running some government workloads in the network’s compute environment) before broad
release. Learning from that, refine, and then roll out gradually to all nodes. By year 3 or so of the
roadmap, compute services could be broadly available across the network.
Future Phases and Vision: A Federated Cloud Ecosystem
Looking beyond Phase 2, SpaceTime envisions additional layers and improvements:
●
●
Network Services and Applications: The higher layers of cloud (Platform as a Service,
Software as a Service) could be fostered atop the infrastructure. This might include an
marketplace for services run on the network – for example, AI model APIs that are
hosted within Europe, or data marketplaces where organizations can share/sell data
under proper controls (leveraging the data sovereignty of the platform).
Automation and AI Ops: As the system grows, applying AI to operations (AIOps) will
become key. The network will generate massive telemetry – ideal for machine learning
●
●
●
algorithms to optimize everything from data placement to power usage. SpaceTime likely
will invest in AI that can predict failures, dynamically adjust replication, or optimize
cost-performance by maybe moving data between storage tiers or locations based on
usage patterns.
Quantum-Safe and Future Tech: Anticipating future threats like quantum computing
breaking encryption, SpaceTime might integrate quantum-safe encryption algorithms
early on (some of which are being standardized by NIST and also considered in EU
security circles). That aligns with the long-term security posture (the Medium blog
mentioned quantum threats to encryption ).
Global Federation: While the primary focus is Europe, the architecture could extend to
allied regions or global partnerships. Perhaps SpaceTime could federate with other
regional sovereign clouds (imagine connecting a Canadian sovereign cloud network that
uses similar tech, such that data exchange between EU and Canada could happen
cloud-to-cloud with both sides in control). However, any such moves would be carefully
evaluated by EU authorities to maintain compliance (potentially only with nations
deemed adequate under GDPR, etc.).
Policy Integration: The network could become a tool for policy enforcement. For
example, the EU’s Data Act will introduce rights for users to port data between providers
easily. SpaceTime’s network inherently allows portability (since it is multi-provider). It
could expose standardized export/import functionalities to comply with that. Also, should
future EU laws require certain certifications (as CISPE called for a cloud label ), the
network could be early to adopt and embody those certifications, essentially being a gold
standard of compliance.
Rollout Strategy and Equal Regional Emphasis:
From day one, SpaceTime is keenly aware that to succeed, the rollout must be inclusive:
●
●
●
●
In marketing, case studies and success stories will be drawn from various countries, not
just one. After Finland, perhaps the next pilots or flagship projects will be in a different
context – say a smart cities project in Spain, a health data collaboration in
Germany, or a financial compliance solution in Luxembourg. This provides each
region a sense of ownership and relevance.
Pricing and support will be localized. All EU customers get uniform treatment – no
favoritism where core EU might get better deals than periphery. If anything, SpaceTime
might temporarily subsidize setups in less-developed digital markets to bring them up to
par, knowing that network effects benefit all.
The partner strategy explicitly includes small and medium cloud providers, not just big
ones. The aim is to uplift the entire European cloud industry, which means even a small
data center in Slovakia can join and contribute a few hundred terabytes to the network
and serve local clients. This distributed approach contrasts hyperscalers who
concentrate huge data centers in a few locations; SpaceTime will have many
modest-sized nodes spread out.
Outreach will also happen in local languages and with sensitivity to local regulations
beyond EU-level (like France’s SecNumCloud requirements, or specific healthcare data
laws in some countries). By meeting these, SpaceTime ensures no region feels the
solution isn’t tailored for them.
Measuring Success: Key milestones might be:
●
●
●
●
1 year: presence in 10 countries, X PB data stored, Y customers.
2 years: presence in 20+ countries, integrate compute beta.
3 years: full EU coverage, compute GA (general availability), perhaps official EU
recognition as a European Digital Infrastructure.
5 years: a robust ecosystem (third-party services on the network), and a sizable market
share of EU cloud (even capturing, say, 10-20% of the new cloud deployments in EU
would be significant given growth trends).
By achieving those, SpaceTime’s federated cloud will move from a novel concept to a
cornerstone of Europe’s digital economy.
Strategic Partnerships and Investments
To execute the roadmap, SpaceTime will leverage:
●
●
●
●
Public Funding: Apply for EU grants or funding programs (like Digital Europe, Horizon
Europe for R&D components, maybe national digital funds) to support R&D and
infrastructure buildout, especially in underserved areas.
Private Investment: As interest grows, likely more investors (possibly European
investment banks or funds focused on infrastructure) will back SpaceTime, seeing both
financial return and strategic importance. Chia Network’s involvement is an example of
industry partnership, and more may follow (perhaps hardware vendors like storage
manufacturers might invest or partner, seeing a market).
Alliances: Working with bodies like CISPE, GAIA-X Association, and standard bodies,
to ensure alignment and possibly recruit their member companies into the network.
Education & Skills: SpaceTime might help create training programs (in partnership with
universities or online platforms) to skill up professionals in distributed cloud
management, blockchain for infrastructure, etc. This ensures there’s talent to operate
and innovate on this new platform in every region.
In conclusion, the roadmap for Nukeproof Protocol is robust and multi-faceted. By executing it,
SpaceTime aims to not only deploy a technology but to cultivate a self-sustaining ecosystem
of sovereign cloud services across Europe. If successful, Europe in a few years’ time will have a
thriving, interoperable network of cloud infrastructure that can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with
the offerings of any hyperscaler – except it will be run on European terms, by European
stakeholders, and for European interests.
Technical Foundations and Principles
(Note: The underlying technology of the Nukeproof Protocol has been touched upon throughout
the document – here we consolidate and expand on those principles to give a cohesive
technical overview. This section is intended for readers seeking a deeper understanding of “how
it works” under the hood.)
At the core of the Nukeproof Protocol’s ability to deliver a secure, decentralized, and efficient
storage network are several key technical foundations. These include the use of blockchain and
proof-of-space-time for coordination, advanced encryption and fragmentation for security, and
modern distributed systems design for reliability and performance. We examine each of these
aspects in turn.
Blockchain Coordination and Proof-of-Space-Time
To coordinate a network of independent storage providers without a centralized authority,
Nukeproof employs a blockchain-based ledger system. This is not a cryptocurrency in the
traditional sense, but a permissioned distributed ledger adapted for infrastructure management.
Each SpaceStation runs a node of this ledger, which reaches consensus on the state of the
network – such as which node is storing which data chunk, which nodes are active, and
verification of storage.
Proof-of-Space-Time (PoST): Instead of proof-of-work (which wastes computation) or pure
proof-of-stake (which doesn’t directly tie to storage), the Nukeproof ledger uses a consensus
mechanism inspired by Proof-of-Space and Time, as pioneered by networks like Chia . In
PoST, nodes (SpaceStations) prove that they have allocated a certain amount of disk space and
maintained it over a period (time). How this works conceptually:
●
●
●
A challenge is periodically issued by the network (e.g., every few minutes). This
challenge is some data that nodes must respond to by demonstrating they have stored
specific data or random values on their disk.
Each SpaceStation has prepared in advance “plots” or stored matrices of cryptographic
data that basically commit their storage to the network. When a challenge comes, a node
can quickly derive an answer if (and only if) it indeed has a lot of space filled with the
right kind of prepared data.
Multiple nodes compete to show a valid proof, and one (or few) are selected to create
the next block in the chain, which might include records like “Node X has verified storing
chunk Y of file Z” or “Node A added 10 TB of capacity” etc.
The PoST approach ties the network’s security to the amount of storage contributed – which is
apt because the service’s main resource is storage. It also is energy-efficient: once space is
plotted, keeping it doesn’t require heavy compute, just some disk space and modest CPU to
respond to challenges . This means running a SpaceStation node is not costly in electricity
beyond the normal needs of running storage servers (unlike Bitcoin mining, for example). The
Chia reference is important – Chia’s network has demonstrated that a decentralized network
can reach Nakamoto-style consensus with far lower energy usage by substituting brute-force
hashing with storage-based proofs .
Federation without Central Trust: The blockchain ensures that no single entity has to be
trusted for record-keeping or coordination:
●
●
●
●
When a new SpaceStation joins, it goes through an initialization on the ledger (which
may involve identity verification by SpaceTime initially, since it’s permissioned – but
afterwards its identity is anchored in the chain).
All transactions (like storing a chunk, transferring responsibility to another node, proof of
replication, etc.) are recorded. Nodes collectively validate these. For example, if node A
claims “I stored chunk X and here’s a hash,
” other nodes can verify that hash against the
original file’s hashes (which might be stored in the chain from when the file was first
uploaded).
Immutable logging means there’s a tamper-proof audit trail. If a node misbehaves (e.g.,
fails to produce proofs or tries to fake data), the consensus will detect discrepancies and
can flag or remove that node (through a collective decision encoded in the protocol).
The ledger could also handle micro-incentives: While the primary model is likely
contractual payments, the chain might still use an internal token or credit system to tally
each node’s contributions and possibly trigger payments. Even if traditional billing is
off-chain, the trustless accounting of how much each did can be on-chain to ensure
fairness and transparency.
It’s noteworthy that the blockchain is mostly a means to an end for Nukeproof – the end being a
robust federation. Users of the storage service don’t interact with the chain directly; they just see
a reliable storage service. The blockchain operates behind the scenes, giving the network many
of the advantageous properties of a public blockchain (decentralization, auditability, fault
tolerance) without exposing complexity to end users.
Data Encryption and Fragmentation (Security by Design)
From the moment data enters the Nukeproof network, it is enveloped in layers of security:
●
●
Client-Side Encryption: Data is encrypted before or as it is uploaded. Typically, the
system will use strong symmetric encryption (like AES-256) for bulk data, with keys
managed in a secure way. Either the user holds the key (for ultimate control), or it’s
managed by a European key management service that the user trusts and can audit.
SpaceTime itself does not need to ever see plaintext data. This approach is similar to
zero-knowledge storage paradigms, where the storage provider cannot read the user’s
data even if it wanted to.
Sharding and Erasure Coding: As discussed, files are broken into pieces. This serves
multiple purposes: parallelism (faster IO by distributing), redundancy (with erasure
coding, you can lose some pieces and still recover the file), and privacy (no single node
has significant context).
○
For example, a file might be split into 10 fragments and encoded such that any 6
of them can reconstruct the whole (using Reed-Solomon codes or similar). These
10 fragments go to 10 different SpaceStations in maybe 10 different countries.
●
●
●
●
An attacker would need to compromise at least 5-6 of those nodes (and break
the encryption on fragments) to get the full file, which is exceedingly difficult.
○
The ratio of data to parity (e.g., 6 out of 10 as above) can be adjusted depending
on desired fault tolerance vs. overhead. Very critical data could be stored with
more redundancy (like 3x full copies across separate locations plus parity
shards).
End-to-End Integrity: Each data chunk is hashed (with something like SHA-256). The
hashes of fragments and of the whole file are stored in the blockchain or metadata. This
means any tampering with a stored fragment is detectable; when a user requests data,
the system recombines chunks and verifies the hash matches the original. Similarly, if bit
rot or corruption occurs on a disk, the node can notice a hash mismatch in its regular
self-checks and alert the network to replace that fragment from others.
Access Control and Authentication: To retrieve or modify data, a user must present
valid credentials (e.g., API keys, OAuth tokens). The network uses these to ensure only
authorized parties’ requests are honored. This is standard in any cloud service, but with
the twist that the enforcement happens in a decentralized way. Possibly SpaceTime
central service might issue short-lived tokens that nodes can verify (so that not every
node has to maintain a full user database). Or the blockchain itself could encode
permissions (though usually that’s too slow for real-time access; likely a hybrid approach
is used).
Confidentiality in Processing: When compute is integrated (Phase 2), techniques like
secure enclaves or homomorphic encryption might be considered to maintain
confidentiality even during processing. But that’s more forward-looking; for now,
encryption at rest and in transit covers the basics robustly.
Compliance Features: Because of encryption and fragmentation, the network inherently
anonymizes stored content from the perspective of the infrastructure operators.
However, compliance might sometimes require actions like deleting all copies of a
particular data item (e.g., fulfilling a GDPR right-to-erasure request). The system is built
to track fragments and erase them on command across all nodes (and verify erasure by
consensus). Also, if law enforcement from an EU country needs to seize certain data
with a warrant, the system can provide it if and only if proper legal steps are followed –
no backdoors, just the ability to locate which shards belong to that data and then, with
appropriate decryption keys provided by the user or as allowed by law, reconstruct it.
This still respects rule-of-law processes fully, in contrast to foreign jurisdictions acting
unilaterally.
Distributed Reliability and Self-Healing
Nukeproof leverages classic and modern distributed system principles:
●
Replication & Fault Tolerance: As noted, multiple copies or parity fragments mean the
loss of any single node’s contribution doesn’t lose data. The system likely keeps a
minimum live replicas count. For instance, it might aim to always have fragments on at
least 3 separate nodes for each piece of data. If it dips below (a node goes offline
●
●
●
●
●
long-term), it triggers replication to restore the count from remaining copies . This
dynamic ensures even as the network grows or some nodes churn out (perhaps a
provider leaves the network or has extended downtime), data durability is maintained.
Geo-Distributed Redundancy: The network can be configured to maximize geographic
diversity of storage. This is what gives it disaster-proof qualities. An enterprise might
choose to ensure their data’s fragments are always in at least 2 or 3 different countries,
protecting against even regional disasters or power grid failures, etc. That said, for
certain data sets that legally must not leave a country, the system can constrain those
accordingly, and within a country still use multi-site if available (like different cities).
Consensus & Consistency: The blockchain provides eventual consistency on
metadata (who stores what, etc.). But for actual file operations, a faster coordination
likely exists. Possibly a separate metadata service or use of something like IPFS
concepts for addressing (each chunk could be content-addressed by its hash, and nodes
advertise what hashes they have). When a user wants a file, a lookup of chunk hash to
node locations is done – the blockchain might assist in that by acting as a decentralized
lookup table. The system would be designed for eventual consistency (meaning all
nodes will agree on the storage state given time), but also ensuring timely availability
(perhaps using redundant references so that even if a recent block isn’t finalized, nodes
can serve data they have).
No Single Point of Failure: Removing central points extends beyond data storage.
Even services like authentication, DNS resolution for the service, etc., should be
multi-site. Perhaps SpaceTime runs control services in several countries and also plans
to eventually decentralize some of those functions too (e.g., use of DHTs – Distributed
Hash Tables – to locate data, which has no central server). This way, the network can
survive even a total loss of central management for a period; the nodes can continue
with the last known state and users can still fetch their data from any accessible node.
Performance Optimization: Techniques like caching frequently accessed data on more
nodes near where it’s needed (while still enforcing policy) will be used. The system might
monitor access patterns: if a particular video or dataset becomes popular in France, the
network might automatically spawn additional cached copies on French SpaceStations
to improve throughput to French users. This is similar to a CDN concept but
user-controlled and transparent. Conversely, cold data might be consolidated or moved
to nodes with cheaper storage (e.g., SpaceStations dedicated to archival storage with
big cheap disks) to optimize costs, yet still keeping enough replicas for safety.
Scalability: The architecture is built to scale horizontally – adding more SpaceStations
increases capacity and throughput linearly. The consensus mechanism chosen (perhaps
some optimized version of Chia’s for permissioned context) should handle growth of
node count. If needed, there could be sharding at blockchain level too (not to confuse
with data sharding; here we mean splitting the ledger into zones by data or geography if
one chain becomes a bottleneck). But given modern blockchains can handle thousands
of nodes, it’s likely fine. Additionally, many operations (like serving data) don’t involve the
chain live; the chain is more for bookkeeping and occasional audits, so throughput of
actual data operations is not bottlenecked by consensus speed.
Alignment with Standards and Interoperability
Technically, SpaceTime isn’t reinventing every wheel – it is combining and extending
technologies in a novel way:
●
●
●
●
It likely uses existing standards for storage access: e.g., S3 API for object storage.
Internally, it translates that to the distributed actions. This means tools and apps that
speak S3 (almost a de facto standard in cloud storage) can work with SpaceTime’s
storage with minimal tweaks. That lowers adoption friction.
It adheres to security standards: TLS 1.3 for all communications, OAuth/OIDC for identity
federation if companies want to use their own login systems, etc.
It may also incorporate standards from initiatives like Gaia-X – for instance, Gaia-X is
defining a set of policy rules and metadata for services. SpaceTime could tag its services
with those, making it easier for users in Gaia-X ecosystems to plug in SpaceTime as
their storage backend with confidence it meets those guidelines.
Data stored could use open formats and the system is likely protocol-agnostic to some
extent: For instance, beyond object storage, maybe they’ll support block storage
volumes (so you could run a VM off it eventually) or file storage (like an NFS share in the
cloud) to cater to different needs.
In summary, the Nukeproof Protocol’s technology stack is an elegant blend of decentralized
ledger trust, robust cryptography, and distributed storage techniques. It transforms a
network of many participants into a unified, self-regulating organism. This technical foundation is
what allows SpaceTime to promise that its storage network is not only safe and sovereign, but
also smart and self-healing. By adhering to these principles, the network ensures it can uphold
the high-level promises made to users and align with the regulatory and strategic imperatives
that necessitated its creation.
(With the technical deep-dive concluded, we now proceed to wrap up our white paper with
strategic alignment and a call to action.)
Strategic Alignment with EU Goals and Policies
As we’ve detailed, the Nukeproof Protocol is deeply intertwined with the evolving landscape of
European digital policy and strategic objectives. In this section, we explicitly map how this
initiative complements and advances the EU’s goals for data protection, cybersecurity, digital
economy growth, and technological sovereignty.
Upholding European Data Protection (GDPR, Schrems II)
The European Union takes pride in having some of the world’s strongest data protection rules
via the GDPR. Nukeproof was designed with GDPR principles at its core:
●
●
●
Data Minimization & Control: By allowing data to remain in the country/region of origin,
and giving clients control over encryption keys, the network ensures that personal data is
not unnecessarily exposed to jurisdictions or parties that have no business need to
access it. This is a form of minimizing risk surface.
Transparency: GDPR demands transparency about where data is and who processes
it. The blockchain ledger can provide an immutable record of data processing events,
and SpaceTime can offer clients clear reports – for example, showing that “Your data
was stored in X, Y, Z locations with these providers” which can be shared with Data
Protection Officers or regulators on request. Few traditional cloud providers give such
specific transparency .
Schrems II Compliance: After Privacy Shield’s invalidation, companies have scrambled
to rely on Standard Contractual Clauses and “supplementary measures” like encryption .
Nukeproof essentially provides those supplementary measures by default: strong
encryption with keys in EU, no reliance on foreign cloud. It thus can be a straightforward
way for companies to stop worrying about Schrems II – if data doesn’t leave, Schrems II
issues largely disappear. In fact, a company could use the network as a way to repatriate
data that was in the US cloud back to EU, to come into compliance with any Data
Protection Authority guidance post-Schrems II. We align with the European Data
Protection Board’s recommendation that companies consider storing data with EU-based
services to avoid Cloud Act conflicts .
Strengthening Cybersecurity and Resilience (NIS2, Cyber Strategy)
The EU’s cybersecurity posture, embodied in directives like NIS2 and broader strategies, is
enhanced by Nukeproof:
●
●
●
Critical Infrastructure Protection: By classifying cloud and MSPs as critical, NIS2
essentially mandates higher security . SpaceTime’s network can be seen as a distributed
critical infrastructure shield. Because it’s inherently resilient and distributed, it’s less
vulnerable to catastrophic failure – which is good for the overall stability of digital
services in Europe. It’s better to have many medium-sized clouds than one giant single
point of failure . This aligns with the EU’s risk-spread approach.
Supply Chain Security: NIS2 compels companies to mind their suppliers. If a hospital
uses a US cloud, that cloud is a supplier that might not meet EU security standards or
could be outside EU jurisdiction – a supply chain risk . With Nukeproof, all infrastructure
suppliers (the SpaceStations) are vetted EU entities, easier to hold accountable and
assess. The entire supply chain (SpaceTime plus node operators) operates under EU
cybersecurity frameworks (and can be audited to NIS2 requirements). So a company
using SpaceTime for storage can more readily demonstrate to regulators that its supply
chain is secure and NIS2-compliant, since European providers are bound by the
stricter EU legal environment .
Incident Reporting & Response: NIS2 requires rapid incident reporting (sometimes 24
hours) and handling . SpaceTime’s centralized monitoring can aid clients in detecting
and reporting incidents related to data storage. If any breach attempt or anomaly
happens on the network, SpaceTime can notify affected clients and authorities swiftly,
potentially even automating parts of the notification process. Plus, because of the
immutable logs, forensic analysis is facilitated. This means using Nukeproof could make
it easier for companies to fulfill their NIS2 obligations – essentially outsourcing some of
the heavy lifting for security monitoring to the network’s built-in capabilities.
Advancing Digital Sovereignty and Autonomy
The EU has openly stated its ambition for technological/digital sovereignty – controlling its
own digital destiny and reducing undue dependence . Nukeproof is a direct enabler of this:
●
●
●
●
Reducing Dependency on Non-EU Providers: Every workload moved to SpaceTime’s
network is one less workload on a foreign hyperscaler, thereby incrementally reducing
the dependency ratio. If widely adopted, it shifts the balance of the European cloud
market to be more self-reliant. This responds to calls like those from CISPE about
independence from foreign governmental influence .
European Alternatives and Competition: The existence of a strong European storage
network gives customers bargaining power and choice. Even those who still use some
hyperscaler services could negotiate better terms or split workloads, knowing they have
a viable alternative that keeps them in compliance. This competitive pressure is healthy
and is likely to push even foreign providers to adapt (indeed, we already see AWS
announcing “EU Sovereign Cloud” offerings – an indicator that they recognize the
demand).
Data Economy Growth within EU: The EU’s data strategy envisions a thriving internal
market for data and cloud services, where data can be shared securely to drive
innovation . Nukeproof lays the infrastructure for that – a sort of pan-European data
marketplace backbone. It can host the envisioned Common European Data Spaces
(sectoral pools of data under EU rules) by providing the trusted environment for data
sharing among organizations. This inherently supports EU’s policy goal of making more
high-quality data available for AI and innovation, without compromising on values like
privacy and fairness.
Alignment with Gaia-X: Gaia-X isn’t a cloud itself but an architecture and set of
standards for federated cloud services in Europe . SpaceTime’s implementation is very
much a realization of Gaia-X principles – federation, interoperability, security, and trust.
In fact, SpaceTime could become one of the first tangible implementations that Gaia-X
can showcase: an “open, transparent, and secure digital ecosystem” in operation . It
fulfills Gaia-X’s aim of mitigating dependency on overseas providers by uniting
Europeans across sectors in a common ecosystem . We anticipate working closely with
Gaia-X working groups to ensure full compatibility (like using Gaia-X’s federated catalog
and identity services), effectively making Nukeproof a part of the Gaia-X family. This
dual-track approach – building a solution while aligning with policy initiatives – increases
the chance of success since we’re pulling in the same direction as EU policymakers and
industry consortiums, not against the grain.
Economic and Industrial Policy Alignment
The European Commission and member states have various programs (e.g., the Important
Project of Common European Interest on Cloud, the Recovery and Resilience Facility
investments in digital, etc.) geared towards boosting the tech sector and achieving digital targets
(like the Digital Decade’s goal: 75% of EU enterprises using cloud/AI by 2030).
●
●
●
SME Digitalization: One target is getting more SMEs to adopt cloud and big data. Many
SMEs have held back due to fear of complexity or distrust of foreign providers. Our pilot
in Finland showed that offering a local, trusted solution can unlock SME uptake. By
rolling this out EU-wide, we directly serve that policy goal of SME digital transformation.
It’s easier to convince a hesitant small business to try cloud backup if you can say “your
data will be stored with a provider in your region, under EU law, and here’s a local
support line”
– it demystifies and de-risks cloud for them.
Building a Homegrown Cloud Industry: This project is also industrial policy in action –
it is essentially scaling up Europe’s indigenous cloud sector by federating it. Instead of
protectionist measures (like excluding foreign firms by law), it’s a competitive measure:
we create a product so good and well-aligned with European needs that it naturally wins
significant market share. This helps European IT firms capture more value. The mention
that redirecting 10% of cloud spend to EU providers equals €20B injection is telling – it’s
a huge economic opportunity. SpaceTime’s strategy is a vehicle to achieve that
rebalancing.
Green Deal Considerations: The EU Green Deal and Climate targets apply to data
centers too (there are goals for data centers to be climate-neutral by 2030, etc.). A
federated approach can actually be beneficial environmentally: SpaceTime can optimize
to run workloads in areas with renewable energy surplus, or offload tasks between
nodes to improve energy efficiency. Additionally, using existing local data centers can be
greener than building mega-datacenters from scratch, especially if those local ones use
waste heat for district heating (as done in Nordics) or other innovations. By coordinating
widely, the network can also shed load during peak grid times (demand response) better
than a rigid large facility. All these possibilities mean Nukeproof can align with Europe’s
sustainable digitalization ethos. SpaceTime can also ensure all partner nodes commit to
improving PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) and share best practices, raising the bar
across many operators – a sort of rising tide for green data centers in Europe.
Regulatory Compliance as a Differentiator
A final point on alignment: as regulations like the AI Act, Data Act, ePrivacy Regulation
(forthcoming), etc., come into play, companies will grapple with compliance. Using infrastructure
that is built to ease compliance will be a major advantage.
●
For example, the AI Act might require that certain high-risk AI training datasets be
traceable and stored securely. SpaceTime can offer features for dataset versioning and
traceability anchored in the ledger, making it easier for AI developers to meet those
requirements.
●
The Data Act’s cloud switching obligation (which will force cloud providers to help
customers port data out) is essentially already satisfied by Nukeproof’s design –
because it’s multi-provider and uses open formats, porting is not a lock-in issue. If a user
wanted to leave, they could retrieve their data directly or move to another service that
could even integrate with our network. In fact, the user could be still in the network since
the network ismulti-provider – they might just choose a different front-end service
provider but the data could technically remain, illustrating how fluid it can be.
In summary, SpaceTime’s Nukeproof Protocol is not operating in a vacuum – it’s almost as if it’s
a child of EU policy, implementing in technology what European lawmakers and strategists are
advocating:
“an infrastructure that strengthens Europe, keeps it competitive and ensures its digital
sovereignty”
.
By aligning so closely with these goals, the initiative not only gains support and relevance, it
also increases its resilience – because it’s hard to undo or undercut something that so clearly
advances shared European interests. This symbiosis between SpaceTime’s strategy and EU’s
digital agenda could very well make Nukeproof Protocol a flagship example of Europe’s “open
strategic autonomy” in the digital field.
Conclusion and Call to Action
Europe stands on the cusp of a new era in its digital evolution. The past decade has taught us
the value of data and the importance of controlling our digital infrastructure. The next decade
will be defined by those who take decisive steps to secure that control while fostering
innovation. The Nukeproof Protocol represents one of those decisive steps – a practical,
technologically advanced, and policy-aligned solution that can anchor Europe’s digital
sovereignty in reality, not just in rhetoric.
In this white paper, we have:
●
●
●
●
Examined the pressing digital sovereignty challenges facing Europe – from legal
rulings like Schrems II to strategic vulnerabilities in cloud dependence – and established
why status quo is not an option for a continent that values privacy, security, and
autonomy.
Introduced the Nukeproof Protocol and SpaceTime’s vision of a federated European
storage network as a compelling answer to those challenges, turning Europe’s strength
(its diverse network of IT providers and strict regulations) into an advantage rather than a
hurdle.
Detailed the architecture and operations of the system, especially the SpaceStations
that will form the backbone of a resilient, sovereign cloud, and reported on a successful
Finland pilot that validates the approach in the real world.
Highlighted the significant benefits across sectors – showing that this isn’t just a niche
idea for tech enthusiasts, but a broad solution improving public services, helping
●
●
●
regulated industries comply and compete, and giving startups and researchers a
platform to thrive without sacrificing control or incurring prohibitive costs.
Outlined a roadmap for expansion and evolution, showing that we have a clear plan to
take this from pilot stage to a pan-European infrastructure with storage today and
compute tomorrow.
Explored the underlying technology and how it reinforces the goals of security, trust,
and performance through innovations like blockchain coordination and
proof-of-space-time.
Crucially, demonstrated alignment with EU policies and values, ensuring that what we
build doesn’t just solve technical problems but also advances Europe’s strategic
objectives in data protection, cybersecurity, economic growth, and environmental
sustainability.
The case is clear: the Nukeproof Protocol is not just another tech project – it is a foundational
infrastructure for Europe’s digital future, analogous to the railways or power grids of the
industrial era, but for the information age.
A Call to European Governments:
Policymakers and public sector leaders, we urge you to actively support and participate in
this initiative. This can take many forms:
●
●
●
●
Adopt sovereign cloud solutions like SpaceTime’s when upgrading your IT systems or
launching new digital services. Issue guidelines or mandates favoring EU-sovereign
options for government procurements (as CISPE recommends ). By becoming early
adopters, you not only secure your own data but also send a strong signal to the market.
Invest in infrastructure: Consider using EU recovery and resilience funds or national
budgets to co-invest in local SpaceStations, especially in regions where private players
may be slower to move. This is akin to investing in national security or essential
infrastructure – a digital public-private partnership for sovereignty.
Facilitate a supportive regulatory environment: Continue to refine laws in ways that
encourage local solutions. For instance, implement the upcoming EU Cloud Rulebook in
a way that emphasizes data sovereignty standards, which networks like Nukeproof meet
by design. Streamline licensing or certification for providers in the federation (perhaps
via a pan-EU cloud security certification) so that it’s easier for them to be recognized as
trustworthy.
Champion the cause internationally: Europe can be a trendsetter. Your backing of
federated sovereign clouds can inspire other regions and create a global movement
towards more balanced cloud ecosystems. This could open markets for European
providers abroad on the basis of trust and compliance.
A Call to Industry Partners:
Cloud providers, data center operators, telcos, MSPs across Europe – this is your
opportunity not just to survive in the shadow of hyperscalers, but to collectively thrive. Join the
Nukeproof Protocol federation:
●
●
●
Become a SpaceStation operator in your area. It’s a chance to monetize spare
capacity, attract new customers with a unique value proposition (sovereign, secure
cloud), and be part of a Europe-wide network. SpaceTime provides the tech and support
to get you onboarded; you bring your local presence and expertise.
Integrate and innovate: If you’re a software company or service provider, build on the
network. Offer value-added services (backup solutions, SaaS applications, AI analytics)
that run on or alongside SpaceTime’s storage. The more vibrant the ecosystem on top of
the infrastructure, the more attractive it becomes to customers. We welcome an
ecosystem of partners.
Collaborate on standards: Through bodies like Gaia-X, help shape the norms for
federated cloud. Ensure interoperability, contribute to open source aspects, and share
best practices. This isn’t a zero-sum game against each other; it’s a collective front
where all honest players can win market share from the status quo.
By coming together, European providers can offer integrated solutions built from certified,
secure components, pooling distributed resources – exactly as industry visionaries suggest
. United, you can compete with any giant while retaining your independence.
A Call to Investors and Innovators:
Investors – both financial and strategic – Europe’s digital independence is not just an idealistic
cause; it’s poised to be a lucrative endeavor. Cloud spending in Europe is tens of billions and
growing double-digit annually. Capturing even a slice of that through a differentiated offering is a
multi-billion euro revenue opportunity. Invest in SpaceTime’s expansion, in allied startups that
will use this platform, and in local data center capacity. Returns will come not just in profits, but
in being part of something transformative for Europe.
●
The backing by organizations like Chia Network shows the interest in bridging blockchain
innovation with real-world infrastructure. Others can join too – whether it’s tech
companies, telecom giants, or venture capital focusing on deep tech. The table is set for
those who see the long-term vision.
European tech community and startups – leverage this new platform. Build the next big
European tech company on an infrastructure that aligns with Europe’s values from the ground
up. Whether you’re doing AI, fintech, healthtech, or any data-heavy venture, consider building
on SpaceTime’s network to ensure from day one that your data and your customers’ data is
protected by EU law. This could save you compliance headaches later and appeal to
privacy-conscious customers.
The Bigger Picture:
The launch of the Nukeproof Protocol comes at a critical juncture. The global pandemic
accelerated digital adoption, but also highlighted supply chain dependencies. Geopolitical
tensions remind us that digital control has national security implications. Europe has all the
talent, capital, and regulatory clarity it needs to assert a different path – one that balances
openness with sovereignty, innovation with ethics.
SpaceTime Ltd, through the Nukeproof Protocol, is offering a concrete mechanism to realize
that vision in the realm of cloud infrastructure. It’s an invitation for Europe to take its destiny
into its own hands in the digital domain.
In calling it “Nukeproof”
, we set a high bar – invoking absolute resilience. That resilience is not
just technical, but also economic and strategic. Together, we can make Europe’s digital
economy truly “nukeproof”
– impervious to external coercion, resilient against failures, and
robust in the face of competition.
We conclude with a call to action: Let’s federate. Let’s innovate. Let’s ensure that
Europe’s digital future is one where our principles shape our technology, and not the
other way around. Governments, companies, and citizens – join us in building a cloud that is
ours, without compromising on performance or ambition. The journey has begun in Finland; it’s
time to expand this constellation of SpaceStations across the European sky.
SpaceTime Ltd is ready to lead this mission, but its success will be a shared triumph – a
testament to European collaboration in the digital age. The Nukeproof Protocol can be the
cornerstone of Europe’s digital sovereignty. We invite you to lay this cornerstone together,
starting now.
Let’s make Europe’s cloud light-years ahead – in security, in compliance, and in trust – for the
generations to come.
